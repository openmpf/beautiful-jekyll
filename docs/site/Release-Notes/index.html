<h1 id="openmpf-500-april-2020">OpenMPF 5.0.0: April 2020</h1>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the openmpf-docker repo <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/SWARM.md">SWARM</a> guide to describes the new build process, which now includes copying the openmpf repo source code into the openmpf-build image instead of using various bind mounts, and building all of the component base builder and executor images.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Install-Guide/index.html">Install Guide</a> with a pointer to the "Quick Start" section on DockerHub.</li>
<li><span style="color:red">TODO: Updated the <a href="../REST-API/index.html">REST API</a> with the new endpoints for getting, deleting, and creating actions, tasks, and pipelines, as well as a change to the <code>[GET] /rest/info</code> endpoint.</span></li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../CPP-Batch-Component-API/index.html">C++ Batch Component API</a>, <a href="../Python-Batch-Component-API/index.html">Python Batch Component API</a>, and <a href="../Java-Batch-Component-API/index.html">Java Batch Component API</a> with <code>MIME_TYPE</code>, <code>FRAME_WIDTH</code>, and <code>FRAME_HEIGHT</code> media properties.</li>
<li><span style="color:red">TODO: Updated the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a> guide for Docker deployment with information on the new build process and component base builder and executor images.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Docker Microservices</h2>

<ul>
<li>Each component is now encapsulated in its own Docker image which self-registers with the Workflow Manager at runtime. This deconflicts component dependencies, and allows for greater flexibility when deciding which components to deploy at runtime.</li>
<li>The Node Manager image has been removed. For Docker deployments, component services should be managed using Docker tools external to OpenMPF.</li>
<li>In Docker deployments, streaming job REST endpoints are disabled, the Nodes web page is no longer available, component tar.gz packages cannot be registered through the Component Registration web page, and the <code>mpf</code> command line script can now only be run on the Workflow Manager container to modify user settings. The preexisting features are now reserved for non-Docker deployments and development environments.</li>
<li><span style="color:red">TODO: The OpenMPF Docker stack can optionally be deployed with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana">Kibana</a> (which depends on Elasticsearch and Filebeat) for viewing log files. Refer to the openmpf-docker <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/README.md#optional-use-kibana-for-log-viewing-and-aggregation">README</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Docker Component Base Images</h2>

<ul>
<li>A base builder image and executor image are provided for C++ (<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/components/cpp_executor/README.md">README</a>), Python (<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/components/python_executor/README.md">README</a>), and Java (<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/components/java_executor/README.md">README</a>) component development. Component developers can also refer to the Dockerfile for each of the component microservices as reference for how to make use of the base images.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:red">Configure Data Types per Component Service</h2>

<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">TODO: Each component service now supports an optional <code>DATA_TYPES</code> Docker environment variable that specifies the types of media that service will process. For example, <code>DATA_TYPES: VIDEO,IMAGE</code> will process both videos and images, while <code>DATA_TYPES: IMAGE</code> will only process images. If not specified, the service will process all of the media types it natively supports. For example, this feature can be used to ensure that some services are always available to process images while others are processing long videos.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>DockerHub</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pushed prebuilt OpenMPF Docker images to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/openmpf">DockerHub</a>. Refer to the "Quick Start" section of the OpenMPF Workflow Manager image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openmpf/openmpf_workflow_manager">documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated from Oracle Java 8 to OpenJDK 11, which required updating to Tomcat 8.5.41. We now use <a href="https://codehaus-cargo.github.io/cargo/Home.html">Cargo</a> to run integration tests.</li>
<li>Updated OpenCV from 3.0.0 to 3.4.7 to update Deep Neural Networks (DNN) support.</li>
</ul>
<h2>FFmpeg</h2>

<ul>
<li>We are no longer building separate audio and video encoders and decoders for FFmpeg. Instead, we are using the built-in decoders that come with FFmpeg by default. This simplifies the build process and redistribution via Docker images.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Artifact Extraction</h2>

<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">TODO: Extracted artifacts are now cropped to the detection region. Previously, the entire frame was extracted.</span></li>
<li>The  <code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY</code> property can now be assigned a value of <code>NONE</code>, <code>VISUAL_TYPES_ONLY</code>, <code>ALL_TYPES</code>, or <code>ALL_DETECTIONS</code>.<ul>
<li>With the <code>VISUAL_TYPES_ONLY</code> or <code>ALL_TYPES</code> policy, artifacts will be extracted according to the <code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY*</code> properties. With the <code>NONE</code> and <code>ALL_DETECTIONS</code> policies, those settings are ignored.,</li>
<li>Note that previously <code>NONE</code>, <code>VISUAL_EXEMPLARS_ONLY</code>, <code>EXEMPLARS_ONLY</code>, <code>ALL_VISUAL_DETECTIONS</code>, and <code>ALL_DETECTIONS</code> were supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following <code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY*</code> properties are now supported:<ul>
<li><code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY_EXEMPLAR_FRAME_PLUS</code>: Extract the exemplar frame from the track, plus this many frames before and after the exemplar.</li>
<li><code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY_FIRST_FRAME</code>: If true, extract the first frame from the track.</li>
<li><code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY_MIDDLE_FRAME</code>: If true, extract the frame with a detection that is closest to the middle frame from the track.</li>
<li><code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY_LAST_FRAME</code>: If true, extract the last frame from the track.</li>
<li><code>ARTIFACT_EXTRACTION_POLICY_TOP_CONFIDENCE_COUNT</code>: Sort the detections in a track by confidence and then extract this many detections, starting with those which have the highest confidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For clarity, <code>OUTPUT_EXEMPLARS_ONLY</code> has been renamed to <code>OUTPUT_ARTIFACTS_AND_EXEMPLARS_ONLY</code>. Extracted artifacts will always be reported in the JSON output object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:red">Job Errors and Warnings</h2>

<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">TODO: When job segments generate errors they will appear in the <code>detectionProcessingErrors</code> collection in the JSON output object. They will also be summarized in the top-level <code>jobErrors</code> collection. Additionally, warnings will be summarized in the top-level <code>jobWarnings</code> collection.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>REST Endpoints</h2>

<ul>
<li>Modified <code>[GET] /rest/info</code>. Now returns output like <code>{"version": "4.1.0", "dockerEnabled": true}</code>.</li>
<li>Added the following REST endpoints for getting, removing, and creating actions, tasks, and pipelines. Refer to the <a href="../REST-API/index.html">REST API</a> for more information:<ul>
<li><code>[GET] \rest\actions</code>, <code>[GET] \rest\tasks</code>, <code>[GET] \rest\pipelines</code></li>
<li><code>[DELETE] \rest\actions</code>, <code>[DELETE] \rest\tasks</code>, <code>[DELETE] \rest\pipelines</code></li>
<li><code>[POST] \rest\actions</code> , <code>[POST] \rest\tasks</code>, <code>[POST] \rest\pipelines</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of the endpoints above are new with the exception of <code>[GET] \rest\pipelines</code>. The endpoint has changed since the last version of OpenMPF. Some fields in the response JSON have been removed and renamed. Also, it now returns a collection of tasks for each pipelines. Refer to the REST API. </li>
<li><code>[GET] \rest\algorithms</code> can be used to get information about algorithms. Note that algorithms are tied to registered components, so to remove an algorithm you must unregister the associated component. To add an algorithm, start the associated component microservice so it self-registers with the Workflow Manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Incomplete Actions, Tasks, and Pipelines</h2>

<ul>
<li>The previous version of OpenMPF would generate an error when attempting to register a component that included actions, tasks, or pipelines that depend on algorithms, actions, or tasks there are not yet registered with the Workflow Manager. This required components to be registered in a specific order. Also, when unregistering a component, it required the components which depend on it to be unregistered. These dependency checks are no longer enforced.</li>
<li>In general, the Workflow Manager now appropriately handles incomplete actions, tasks, and pipelines by checking if all of the elements are defined before executing a job, and then preserving that information in memory until the job is complete. This allows components to be registered and removed in an arbitrary order without affecting the state of other components, actions, tasks, or pipelines. This also allows actions and tasks to be removed using the new REST endpoints and then re-added at a later time while still preserving the elements that depend on them.</li>
<li>Note that unregistering a component while a job is running will cause it to stall. Please ensure that no jobs are using a component before unregistering it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Arbitrary Rotation</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Python MPFVideoCapture and MPFImageReader tools now support <code>ROTATION</code> values other than 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. Users can now specify a clockwise <code>ROTATION</code> job property in the range [0, 360). Values outside that range will be normalized to that range. Floating point values are accepted. This is similar to the existing support for <a href="#cpp-arbitrary-rotation">C++ arbitrary rotation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OpenCV Deep Neural Networks (DNN) Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>This new component replaces the old CaffeDetection component. It supports the same GoogLeNet and Yahoo Not Suitable For Work (NSFW) models as the old component, but removes support for the Rezafuad vehicle color detection model in favor of a custom TensorFlow vehicle color detection model. In our tests, the new model has proven to be more generalizable and provide more accurate results on never-before-seen test data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tesseract OCR Text Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>Text tagging has been simplified to only support regular expression searches. Whole keyword searches are a subset of regular expression searches, and are therefore still supported. Also, the <code>text-tags.json</code> file format has been updated to allow for specifying case-sensitive regular expression searches. For example: <code>{"pattern": "(\\b)bus(\\b)", "caseSensitive": true}</code>. Additionally, the <code>TRIGGER_WORDS</code> and <code>TRIGGER_WORDS_OFFSET</code> detection properties are now supported, which list the OCR'd words that resulted in adding a <code>TAG</code> to the detection, and the character offset of those words within the OCR'd <code>TEXT</code>, respectively. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/cpp/TesseractOCRTextDetection/README.md#text-tagging">README</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>MAX_PARALLEL_SCRIPT_THREADS</code> and <code>MAX_PARALLEL_PAGE_THREADS</code> properties are now supported. When processing images, the first property is used to determine how many threads to run in parallel. Each thread performs OCR using a different language or script model. When processing PDFs, the second property is used to determine how many threads to run in parallel. Each thread performs OCR on a different page of the PDF.</li>
<li>The <code>ENABLE_OSD_FALLBACK</code> property is now supported. If enabled, an additional round of OSD is performed when the first round fails to generate script predictions that are above the OSD score and confidence thresholds. In the second pass, the component will run OSD on multiple copies of the input text image to get an improved prediction score and <code>OSD_FALLBACK_OCCURRED</code> detection property will be set to true.</li>
<li>If any OSD-detected models are missing, the new <code>MISSING_LANGUAGE_MODELS</code> detection property will list the missing models.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tika Text Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Tika text detection component now supports text tagging in the same way as the Tesseract component. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/java/TikaTextDetection/README.md#text-tagging">README</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>mediaProperties</code> map in the JSON output object now contains a <code>MIME_TYPE</code> property for all media types, as well as a <code>FRAME_WIDTH</code> and <code>FRAME_HEIGHT</code> property for images and videos.</li>
<li>Simplified component <code>descriptor.json</code> files by moving the specification of common properties, such as <code>CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD</code>, <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code>, <code>MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH</code>, etc., to a single <code>workflow-properties.json</code> file. Now when the Workflow Manager is updated to support new features, the component <code>descriptor.json</code> file will not need to be updated.</li>
<li>Updated the Sphinx component to return <code>TRANSCRIPT</code> instead of <code>TRANSCRIPTION</code>, which is grammatically correct.</li>
<li>Whitespace is now trimmed from property names when jobs are submitted via the REST API.</li>

<h1 id="openmpf-414-march-2020">OpenMPF 4.1.4: March 2020</h1>
<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated from Hibernate 5.0.8 to 5.4.12 to support schema-based multitenancy. This allows multiple instances of OpenMPF to use the same PostgreSQL database as long as each instance connects to the database as a separate user, and the database is configured appropriately. This also required updating Tomcat from 7.0.72 to 7.0.76.</li>
<li>Updated the Workflow Manager to include an <code>outputobjecturi</code> in GET and POST callbacks when jobs complete. This URI specifies a file path, or path on the object storage server, depending on where the JSON output object is located.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="openmpf-413-february-2020">OpenMPF 4.1.3: February 2020</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for <code>DETECTION_PADDING_X</code> and <code>DETECTION_PADDING_Y</code> optional job properties. The value can be a percentage or whole-number pixel value. When positive, each detection region in each track will be expanded. When negative, the region will shrink. If the detection region is shrunk to nothing, the shrunk dimension(s) will be set to a value of 1 pixel and the <code>SHRUNK_TO_NOTHING</code> detection property will be set to true.</li>
<li>Added support for <code>DISTANCE_CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT_FACTOR</code> and <code>SIZE_CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT_FACTOR</code> SuBSENSE algorithm properties. Increasing the value of the first property will generate detection confidence values that favor being closer to the center frame of a track. Increasing the value of the second property will generate detection confidence values that favor large detection regions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="openmpf-411-january-2020">OpenMPF 4.1.1: January 2020</h1>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/1016">#1016</a>] Fixed a bug that caused a deadlock situation when the media inspection process failed quickly when processing many jobs using a pipeline with more than one stage.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="openmpf-410-july-2019">OpenMPF 4.1.0: July 2019</h1>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the <a href="../CPP-Batch-Component-API/index.html#mpfimagelocation">C++ Batch Component API</a> to describe the <code>ROTATION</code> detection property. See the <a href="#cpp-arbitrary-rotation">C++ Arbitrary Rotation</a> section below.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../REST-API/index.html">REST API</a> with new component registration REST endpoints. See the <a href="#component-registration-rest-endpoints">Component Registration REST Endpoints</a> section below.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/develop/python/EastTextDetection/README.md">README</a> for the EAST text region detection component. See the <a href="#east-text-region-detection-component">EAST Text Region Detection Component</a> section below.</li>
<li>Updated the Tesseract OCR text detection component <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/develop/cpp/TesseractOCRTextDetection/README.md">README</a>. See the  <a href="#tesseract-ocr-text-detection-component">Tesseract OCR Text Detection Component</a> section below.</li>
<li>Updated the openmpf-docker repo <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/develop/README.md">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/develop/SWARM.md">SWARM</a> guide to describe the new streamlined approach to using <code>docker-compose config</code>. See the <a href="#docker-deployment">Docker Deployment</a> section below.</li>
<li>Fixed the description of <code>MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH</code> and associated examples in the <a href="../User-Guide/index.html#min_segment_length-property">User Guide</a> for issue <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/891">#891</a>.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Java-Batch-Component-API/index.html#logging">Java Batch Component API</a> with information on how to use Log4j2. Related to resolving issue <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/855">#855</a>.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Install-Guide/index.html">Install Guide</a> to point to the Docker <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/README.md#getting-started">README</a>.</li>
<li>Transformed the Build Guide into a <a href="../Development-Environment-Guide/index.html">Development Environment Guide</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="cpp-arbitrary-rotation"></span>
<h2>C++ Arbitrary Rotation</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>The C++ MPFVideoCapture and MPFImageReader tools now support <code>ROTATION</code> values other than 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. Users can now specify a clockwise <code>ROTATION</code> job property in the range [0, 360). Values outside that range will be normalized to that range. Floating point values are accepted.</li>
<li>When using those tools to read frame data, they will automatically correct for rotation so that the returned frame is horizontally oriented toward the normal 3 o'clock position.<ul>
<li>When <code>FEED_FORWARD_TYPE=REGION</code>, these tools will look for a <code>ROTATION</code> detection property in the feed-forward detections and automatically correct for rotation. For example, a detection property of <code>ROTATION=90</code> represents that the region is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise, and therefore must be rotated 90 degrees clockwise to correct for it.</li>
<li>When <code>FEED_FORWARD_TYPE=SUPERSET_REGION</code>, these tools will properly account for the <code>ROTATION</code> detection property associated with each feed-forward detection when calculating the bounding box that encapsulates all of those regions.</li>
<li>When <code>FEED_FORWARD_TYPE=FRAME</code>, these tools will rotate the frame according to the <code>ROTATION</code> job property. It's important to note that for rotations other than 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees the rotated frame dimensions will be larger than the original frame dimensions. This is because the  frame needs to be expanded to encapsulate the entirety of the original rotated frame region. Black pixels are used to fill the empty space near the edges of the original frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Markup component now places a colored dot at the upper-left corner of each detection region so that users can determine the rotation of the region relative to the entire frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="component-registration-rest-endpoints"></span>
<h2>Component Registration REST Endpoints</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a <code>[POST] /rest/components/registerUnmanaged</code> endpoint so that components running as separate Docker containers can self-register with the Workflow Manager.<ul>
<li>Since these components are not managed by the Node Manager, they are considered unmanaged OpenMPF components. These components are not displayed in Nodes web UI and are tagged as unmanaged in the Component Registration web UI where they can only be removed.</li>
<li>Note that components uploaded to the Component Registration web UI as .tar.gz files are considered managed components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a <code>[DELETE] /rest/components/{componentName}</code> endpoint that can be used to remove managed and unmanaged components.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Component Executor Docker Image</h2>

<ul>
<li>Component developers can now use a Python component executor Docker image to write a Python component for OpenMPF that can be encapsulated
within a Docker container. This isolates the build and execution environment from the rest of OpenMPF. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/develop/openmpf_runtime/python_executor/README.md">README</a>.</li>
<li>Components developed with this image are not managed by the Node Manager; rather, they self-register with the Workflow Manager and their lifetime is determined by their own Docker container.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docker-deployment"></span>
<h2>Docker Deployment</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlined single-host <code>docker-compose up</code> deployments and multi-host <code>docker stack deploy</code> swarm deployments. Now users are instructed to create a single <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file for both types of deployments.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>docker-generate-compose-files.sh</code> script in favor of allowing users the flexibility of combining multiple <code>docker-compose.*.yml</code> files together using <code>docker-compose config</code>. See the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/develop/README.md#generate-docker-composeyml">Generate docker-compose.yml</a> section of the README.</li>
<li>Components based on the Python component executor Docker image can now be defined and configured directly in <code>docker-compose.yml</code>.</li>
<li>OpenMPF Docker images now make use of Docker labels.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="east-text-region-detection-component"></span>
<h2>EAST Text Region Detection Component</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>This new component uses the Efficient and Accurate Scene Text (EAST) detection model to detect text regions in images and videos. It reports their location, angle of rotation, and text type (<code>STRUCTURED</code> or <code>UNSTRUCTURED</code>), and supports a variety of settings to control the behavior of merging text regions into larger regions. It does not perform OCR on the text or track detections across video frames. Thus, each video track is at most one detection long. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/develop/python/EastTextDetection/README.md">README</a>.</li>
<li>Optionally, this component can be built as a Docker image using the Python component executor Docker image, allowing it to exist apart from the Node Manager image.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="tesseract-ocr-text-detection-component"></span>
<h2>Tesseract OCR Text Detection Component</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support reading tessdata <code>*.traineddata</code> files at a specified <code>MODELS_DIR_PATH</code>. This allows users to install new <code>*.traineddata</code> files post deployment.</li>
<li>Updated to optionally perform Tesseract Orientation and Script Detection (OSD). When enabled, the component will attempt to use the orientation results of OSD to automatically rotate the image, as well as perform OCR using the scripts detected by OSD.</li>
<li>Updated to optionally rotate a feed-forward text region 180 degrees to account for upside-down text.</li>
<li>Now supports the following preprocessing properties for both structured and unstructured text:<ul>
<li>Text sharpening</li>
<li>Text rescaling</li>
<li>Otsu image thresholding</li>
<li>Adaptive thresholding</li>
<li>Histogram equalization</li>
<li>Adaptive histogram equalization (also known as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will use the <code>TEXT_TYPE</code> detection property in feed-forward regions provided by the EAST component to determine which preprocessing steps to perform.</li>
<li>For more information on these new features, see the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/develop/cpp/TesseractOCRTextDetection/README.md">README</a>.</li>
<li>Removed gibberish and string filters since they only worked on English text.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ActiveMQ Profiles</h2>

<ul>
<li>The ActiveMQ Docker image now supports custom profiles. The container selects an <code>activemq.xml</code> and <code>env</code> file to use at runtime based on the value of the <code>ACTIVE_MQ_PROFILE</code> environment variable. Among others, these files contain configuration settings for Java heap space and component queue memory limits.</li>
<li>This release only supports a <code>default</code> profile setting, as defined by <code>activemq-default.xml</code> and <code>env.default</code>; however, developers are free to add other <code>activemq-&lt;profile&gt;.xml</code> and <code>env.&lt;profile&gt;</code> files to the ActiveMQ Docker image to suit their needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disabled ActiveMQ Prefetch</h2>

<ul>
<li>Disabled ActiveMQ prefetching on all component queues. Previously, a prefetch value of one was resulting in situations where one component service could be dispatched two sub-jobs, thereby starving other available component services which could process one of those sub-jobs in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Search Region Percentages</h2>

<ul>
<li>In addition to using exact pixel values, users can now use percentages for the following properties when specifying search regions for C++ and Python components:<ul>
<li><code>SEARCH_REGION_TOP_LEFT_X_DETECTION</code></li>
<li><code>SEARCH_REGION_TOP_LEFT_Y_DETECTION</code></li>
<li><code>SEARCH_REGION_BOTTOM_RIGHT_X_DETECTION</code></li>
<li><code>SEARCH_REGION_BOTTOM_RIGHT_Y_DETECTION</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, setting <code>SEARCH_REGION_TOP_LEFT_X_DETECTION=50%</code> will result in components only processing the right half of an image or video.</li>
<li>Optionally, users can specify exact pixel values of some of these properties and percentages for others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Increased the number of ActiveMQ maxConcurrentConsumers for the <code>MPF.COMPLETED_DETECTIONS</code> queue from 30 to 60.</li>
<li>The Create Job web UI now only displays the content of the <code>$MPF_HOME/share/remote-media</code> directory instead of all of <code>$MPF_HOME/share</code>, which prevents the Workflow Manager from indexing generated JSON output files, artifacts, and markup. Indexing the latter resulted in Java heap space issues for large scale production systems. This is a mitigation for issue <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/897">#897</a>.</li>
<li>The Job Status web UI now makes proper use of pagination in SQL/Hibernate through the Workflow Manager to avoid retrieving the entire jobs table, which was inefficient.</li>
<li>The Workflow Manager will now silently discard all duplicate messages in the ActiveMQ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), regardless of destination. Previously, only messages destined for component sub-job request queues were discarded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/891">#891</a>] Fixed a bug where the Workflow Manager media segmenter generated short segments that were minimally <code>MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH+1</code> in size instead of <code>MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH</code>.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/745">#745</a>] In environments where thousands of jobs are processed, users have observed that, on occasion, pending sub-job messages in ActiveMQ queues are not processed until a new job is created. This seems to have been resolved by disabling ActiveMQ prefetch behavior on component queues.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/855">#855</a>] A logback circular reference suppressed exception no longer throws a StackOverflowError. This was resolved by transitioning the Workflow Manager and Java components from the Logback framework to Log4j2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/897">#897</a>] OpenMPF will attempt to index files located in <code>$MPF_HOME/share</code> as soon as the webapp is started by Tomcat. This is so that those files can be listed in a directory tree in the Create Job web UI. The main problem is that once a file gets indexed it's never removed from the cache, even if the file is manually deleted, resulting in a memory leak.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Late Additions: November 2019</h2>

<ul>
<li>User names, roles, and passwords can now be set by using an optional <code>user.properties</code> file. This allows administrators to override the default OpenMPF users that come preconfigured, which may be a security risk. Refer to the "Configure Users" section of the openmpf-docker <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/README.md#optional-configure-users">README</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Late Additions: December 2019</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transitioned from using a mySQL persistent database to PostgreSQL to support users that use an external PostgreSQL database in the cloud. </li>
<li>Updated the EAST component to support a <code>TEMPORARY_PADDING</code> and <code>FINAL_PADDING</code> property. The first property determines how much padding is added to detections during the non-maximum suppression or merging step. This padding is effectively removed from the final detections. The second property is used to control the final amount of padding on the output regions. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/python/EastTextDetection/README.md#properties">README</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="openmpf-400-february-2019">OpenMPF 4.0.0: February 2019</h1>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added an <a href="../Object-Storage-Guide/index.html">Object Storage Guide</a> with information on how to configure OpenMPF to work with a custom NGINX object storage server, and how to run jobs that use an S3 object storage server. Note that the system properties for the custom NGINX object storage server have changed since the last release.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrade to Tesseract 4.0</h2>

<ul>
<li>Both the Tesseract OCR Text Detection Component and OpenALPR License Plate Detection Components have been updated to use the new version of Tesseract.</li>
<li>Additionally, Leptonica has been upgraded from 1.72 to 1.75.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Docker Deployment</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Docker images now use the yum package manager to install ImageMagick6 from a public RPM repository instead of downloading the RPMs directly from imagemagick.org. This resolves an issue with the OpenMPF Docker build where RPMs on <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php">imagemagick.org</a> were no longer available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tesseract OCR Text Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated to allow the user to set a <code>TESSERACT_OEM</code> property in order to select an OCR engine mode (OEM).</li>
<li>"script/Latin" can now be specified as the <code>TESSERACT_LANGUAGE</code>. When selected, Tesseract will select all Latin characters, which can be from different Latin languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ceph S3 Object Storage</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for downloading files from, and uploading files to, an S3 object storage server. The following job properties can be provided: <code>S3_ACCESS_KEY</code>, <code>S3_SECRET_KEY</code>, <code>S3_RESULTS_BUCKET</code>, <code>S3_UPLOAD_ONLY</code>.</li>
<li>At this time, only support for Ceph object storage has been tested. However, the Workflow Manager uses the AWS SDK for Java to communicate with the object store, so it is possible that other S3-compatible storage solutions may work as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ISO-8601 Timestamps</h2>

<ul>
<li>All timestamps in the JSON output object, and streaming video callbacks, are now in the ISO-8601 format (e.g. "2018-12-19T12:12:59.995-05:00"). This new format includes the time zone, which makes it possible to compare timestamps generated between systems in different time zones.</li>
<li>This change does not affect the track and detection start and stop offset times, which are still reported in milliseconds since the start of the video.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reduced Redis Usage</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Workflow Manager has been refactored to reduce usage of the Redis in-memory database. In general, Redis is not necessary for storing job information and only resulted in introducing potential delays in accessing that data over the network stack.</li>
<li>Now, only track and detection data is stored in Redis for batch jobs. This reduces the amount of memory the Workflow Manager requires of the Java Virtual Machine. Compared to the other job information, track and detection data can potentially be relatively much larger. In the future, we plan to store frame data in Redis for streaming jobs as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caffe Vehicle Color Estimation</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Caffe Component <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/cpp/CaffeDetection/plugin-files/models/models.ini">models.ini</a> file has been updated with a "vehicle_color" section with links for downloading the <a href="https://github.com/rezafuad/vehicle-color-recognition">Reza Fuad Rachmadi's Vehicle Color Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network</a> model files.</li>
<li>The following pipelines have been added. These require the above model files to be placed in <code>$MPF_HOME/share/models/CaffeDetection</code>:<ul>
<li><code>CAFFE REZAFUAD VEHICLE COLOR DETECTION PIPELINE</code></li>
<li><code>CAFFE REZAFUAD VEHICLE COLOR DETECTION (WITH FF REGION FROM TINY YOLO VEHICLE DETECTOR) PIPELINE</code></li>
<li><code>CAFFE REZAFUAD VEHICLE COLOR DETECTION (WITH FF REGION FROM YOLO VEHICLE DETECTOR) PIPELINE</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Track Merging and Minimum Track Length</h2>

<ul>
<li>The following system properties now have "video" in their names:<ul>
<li><code>detection.video.track.merging.enabled</code></li>
<li><code>detection.video.track.min.gap</code></li>
<li><code>detection.video.track.min.length</code></li>
<li><code>detection.video.track.overlap.threshold</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The above properties can be overridden by the following job properties, respectively. These have not been renamed since the last release:<ul>
<li><code>MERGE_TRACKS</code></li>
<li><code>MIN_GAP_BETWEEN_TRACKS</code></li>
<li><code>MIN_TRACK_LENGTH</code></li>
<li><code>MIN_OVERLAP</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These system and job properties now only apply to video media. This resolves an issue where users had set <code>detection.track.min.length=5</code>, which resulted in dropping all image media tracks. By design, each image track can only contain a single detection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Docker entrypoint scripts appended properties to the end of <code>$MPF_HOME/share/config/mpf-custom.properties</code> every time the Docker deployment was restarted, resulting in entries like <code>detection.segment.target.length=5000,5000,5000</code>.</li>
<li>Upgrading to Tesseract 4 fixes a bug where, when specifying <code>TESSERACT_LANGUAGE</code>, if one of the languages is Arabic, then Arabic must be specified last. Arabic can now be specified first, for example: <code>ara+eng</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the minimum track length property was being applied to image tracks. Now it's only applied to video tracks.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where ImageMagick6 installation failed while building Docker images.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <a href="../Build-Environment-Setup-Guide/index.html">Build Guide</a> and <a href="../Install-Guide/index.html">Install Guide</a> are outdated. The old process for manually configuring a Build VM, using it to build an OpenMPF package, and installing that package, is deprecated in favor of Docker containers. Please refer to the openmpf-docker <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not attempt to register or unregister a component through the Nodes UI in a Docker deployment. It may appear to succeed, but the changes will not affect the child Node Manager containers, only the Workflow Manager container. Also, do not attempt to use the <code>mpf</code> command line tools in a Docker deployment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added a <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/SWARM.md">SWARM</a> guide, and <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a> guide for Docker deployment.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../User-Guide/index.html#min_gap_between_segments-property">User Guide</a> with information on how track properties and track confidence are handled when merging tracks.</li>
<li>Added README files for new components. Refer to the component sections below.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Docker Support</h2>

<ul>
<li>OpenMPF can now be built and distributed as 5 Docker images: openmpf_workflow_manager, openmpf_node_manager, openmpf_active_mq, mysql_database, and redis.</li>
<li>These images can be deployed on a single host using <code>docker-compose up</code>.</li>
<li>They can also be deployed across multiple hosts in a Docker swarm cluster using <code>docker stack deploy</code>.</li>
<li>GPU support is enabled through the NVIDIA Docker runtime.</li>
<li>Both HTTP and HTTPS deployments are supported.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="json-output-object"></span>
<h2>JSON Output Object</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a <code>trackProperties</code> field at the track level that works in much the same way as the <code>detectionProperties</code> field at the detection level. Both are maps that contain zero or more key-value pairs. The component APIs have always supported the ability to return track-level properties, but they were never represented in the JSON output object, until now.</li>
<li>Similarly, added a track <code>confidence</code> field. The component APIs always supported setting it, but the value was never used in the JSON output object, until now.</li>
<li>Added <code>jobErrors</code> and<code>jobWarnings</code> fields. The <code>jobErrors</code> field will mention that there are items in <code>detectionProcessingErrors</code> fields.</li>
<li>The <code>offset</code>, <code>startOffset</code>, and <code>stopOffset</code> fields have been removed in favor of the existing <code>offsetFrame</code>, <code>startOffsetFrame</code>, and <code>stopOffsetFrame</code> fields, respectively. They were redundant and deprecated.</li>
<li>Added a <code>mpf.output.objects.exemplars.only</code> system property, and <code>OUTPUT_EXEMPLARS_ONLY</code> job property, that can be set to reduce the size of the JSON output object by only recording the track exemplars instead of all of the detections in each track.</li>
<li>Added a <code>mpf.output.objects.last.stage.only</code> system property, and <code>OUTPUT_LAST_STAGE_ONLY</code> job property, that can be set to reduce the size of the JSON output object by only recording the detections for the last non-markup stage of a pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Darknet Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Darknet component can now support processing streaming video.</li>
<li>In batch mode, video frames are prefetched, decoded, and stored in a buffer using a separate thread from the one that performs the detection. The size of the prefetch buffer can be configured by setting <code>FRAME_QUEUE_CAPACITY</code>.</li>
<li>The Darknet component can now perform basic tracking and generate video tracks with multiple detections. Both the default detection mode and preprocessor detection mode are supported.</li>
<li>The Darknet component has been updated to support the full and tiny YOLOv3 models. The YOLOv2 models are no longer supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tesseract OCR Text Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>This new component extracts text found in an image and reports it as a single-detection track.</li>
<li>PDF documents can also be processed with one track detection per page.</li>
<li>Users may set the language of each track using the <code>TESSERACT_LANGUAGE</code> property as well as adjust other image preprocessing properties for text extraction.</li>
<li>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/cpp/TesseractOCRTextDetection/README.md">README</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OpenCV Scene Change Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>This new component detects and segments a given video by scenes. Each scene change is detected using histogram comparison, edge comparison, brightness (fade outs), and overall hue/saturation/value differences between adjacent frames.</li>
<li>Users can toggle each type of of scene change detection technique as well as threshold properties for each detection method.</li>
<li>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/cpp/SceneChangeDetection/README.md">README</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tika Text Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>This new component extracts text contained in documents and performs language detection. 71 languages and most document formats (.txt, .pptx, .docx, .doc, .pdf, etc.) are supported.</li>
<li>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/java/TikaTextDetection/README.md">README</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tika Image Detection Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>This new component extracts images embedded in document formats (.pdf, .ppt, .doc) and stores them on disk in a specified directory.</li>
<li>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-components/blob/master/java/TikaImageDetection/README.md">README</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Track-Level Properties and Confidence</h2>

<ul>
<li>Refer to the addition of track-level properties and confidence in the <a href="#json-output-object">JSON Output Object</a> section.</li>
<li>Components have been updated to return meaningful track-level properties. Caffe and Darknet include <code>CLASSIFICATION</code>, OALPR includes the exemplar <code>TEXT</code>, and Sphinx includes the <code>TRANSCRIPTION</code>.</li>
<li>The Workflow Manager will now populate the track-level confidence. It is the same as the exemplar confidence, which is the max of all of the track detections.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom NGINX HTTP Object Storage</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added <code>http.object.storage.*</code> system properties for configuring an optional custom NGINX object storage server on which to store generated detection artifacts, JSON output objects, and markup files.</li>
<li>When a file cannot be uploaded to the server, the Workflow Manager will fall back to storing it in <code>$MPF_HOME/share</code>, which is the default behavior when an object storage server is not specified.</li>
<li>If and when a failure occurs, the JSON output object will contain a descriptive message in the <code>jobWarnings</code> field, and, if appropriate, the <code>markupResult.message</code> field. If the job completes without other issues, the final status will be <code>COMPLETE_WITH_WARNINGS</code>.</li>
<li>The NGINX storage server runs custom server-side code which we can make available upon request. In the future, we plan to support more common storage server solutions, such as Amazon S3.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="activemq"></span>
<h2>ActiveMQ</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>MPF_OUTPUT</code> queue is no longer supported and has been removed. Job producers can specify a callback URL when creating a job so that they are alerted when the job is complete. Users observed heap space issues with ActiveMQ after running thousands of jobs without consuming messages from the <code>MPF_OUTPUT</code> queue.</li>
<li>The Workflow Manager will now silently discard duplicate sub-job request messages in the ActiveMQ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). This fixes a bug where the Workflow Manager would prematurely terminate jobs corresponding to the duplicate messages. It's assumed that ActiveMQ will only place a duplicate message in the DLQ if the original message, or another duplicate, can be delivered.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Node Auto-Configuration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added the <code>node.auto.config.enabled</code>, <code>node.auto.unconfig.enabled</code>, and <code>node.auto.config.num.services.per.component</code> system properties for automatically managing the configuration of services when nodes join and leave the OpenMPF cluster.</li>
<li>Docker will assign a a hostname with a randomly-generated id to containers in a swarm deployment. The above properties allow the Workflow Manager to automatically discover and configure services on child Node Manager components, which is convenient since the hostname of those containers cannot be known in advance, and new containers with new hostnames are created when the swarm is restarted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Job Status Web UI</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added the <code>web.broadcast.job.status.enabled</code> and <code>web.job.polling.interval</code> system properties that can be used to configure if the Workflow Manager automatically broadcasts updates to the Job Status web UI. By default, the broadcasts are enabled.</li>
<li>In a production environment that processes hundreds of jobs or more at the same time, this behavior can result in overloading the web UI, causing it to slow down and freeze up. To prevent this, set <code>web.broadcast.job.status.enabled</code> to <code>false</code>. If <code>web.job.polling.interval</code> is set to a non-zero value, the web UI will poll for updates at that interval (specified in milliseconds).</li>
<li>To disable broadcasts and polling, set <code>web.broadcast.job.status.enabled</code> to <code>false</code> and <code>web.job.polling.interval</code> to a zero or negative value. Users will then need to manually refresh the Job Status web page using their web browser.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Now using variable-length text fields in the mySQL database for string data that may exceed 255 characters.</li>
<li>Updated the MPFImageReader tool to use OpenCV video capture behind the scenes to support reading data from HTTP URLs.</li>
<li>Python components can now include pre-built wheel files in the plugin package.</li>
<li>We now use a <a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/Jenkinsfile">Jenkinsfile</a> Groovy script for our Jenkins build process. This allows us to use revision control for our continuous integration process and share that process with the open source community.</li>
<li>Added <code>remote.media.download.retries</code> and <code>remote.media.download.sleep</code> system properties that can be used to configure how the Workflow Manager will attempt to retry downloading remote media if it encounters a problem.</li>
<li>Artifact extraction now uses MPFVideoCapture, which employs various fallback strategies for extracting frames in cases where a video is not well-formed or corrupted. For components that use MPFVideoCapture, this enables better consistency between the frames they process and the artifacts that are later extracted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Jobs now properly end in <code>ERROR</code> if an invalid media URL is provided or there is a problem accessing remote media.</li>
<li>Jobs now end in <code>COMPLETE_WITH_ERRORS</code> when a detection splitter error occurs due to missing system properties.</li>
<li>Components can now include their own version of the Google Protobuf library. It will not conflict with the version used by the rest of OpenMPF.</li>
<li>The Java component executor now sets the proper job id in the job name instead of using the ActiveMQ message request id.</li>
<li>The Java component executor now sets the run directory using <code>setRunDirectory()</code>.</li>
<li>Actions can now be properly added using an "extras" component. An extras component only includes a <code>descriptor.json</code> file and declares Actions, Tasks, and Pipelines using other component algorithms.</li>
<li>Refer to the items listed in the <a href="#activemq">ActiveMQ</a> section.</li>
<li>Refer to the addition of track-level properties and confidence in the <a href="#json-output-object">JSON Output Object</a> section.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/745">#745</a>] In environments where thousands of jobs are processed, users have observed that, on occasion, pending sub-job messages in ActiveMQ queues are not processed until a new job is created. The reason is currently unknown.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/544">#544</a>] Image artifacts retain some permissions from source files available on the local host. This can result in some of the image artifacts having executable permissions.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/604">#604</a>] The Sphinx component cannot be unregistered because <code>$MPF_HOME/plugins/SphinxSpeechDetection/lib</code> is owned by root on a deployment machine.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/623">#623</a>] The Nodes UI does not work correctly when <code>[POST] /rest/nodes/config</code> is used at the same time. This is because the UI's state is not automatically updated to reflect changes made through the REST endpoint.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/783">#783</a>] The Tesseract OCR Text Detection Component has a <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/235">known issue</a> because it uses Tesseract 3. If a combination of languages is specified using <code>TESSERACT_LANGUAGE</code>, and one of the languages is Arabic, then Arabic must be specified last. For example, for English and Arabic, <code>eng+ara</code> will work, but <code>ara+eng</code> will not.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/784">#784</a>] Sometimes services do not start on OpenMPF nodes, and those services cannot be started through the Nodes web UI. This is not a Docker-specific problem, but it has been observed in a Docker swarm deployment when auto-configuration is enabled. The workaround is to restart the Docker swarm deployment, or remove the entire node in the Nodes UI and add it again.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="openmpf-210-june-2018">OpenMPF 2.1.0: June 2018</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If building this release on a machine used to build a previous version of OpenMPF, then please run <code>sudo pip install --upgrade pip</code> to update to at least pip 10.0.1. If not, the OpenMPF build script will fail to properly download .whl files for Python modules.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added the <a href="../Python-Batch-Component-API/index.html">Python Batch Component API</a>.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="../Node-Guide/index.html">Node Guide</a>.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="../GPU-Support-Guide">GPU Support Guide</a>.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Install-Guide/index.html">Install Guide</a> with an "(Optional) Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit" section.</li>
<li>Renamed Admin Manual to Admin Guide for consistency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Batch Component API</h2>

<ul>
<li>Developers can now write batch components in Python using the mpf_component_api module.</li>
<li>Dependencies can be specified in a setup.py file. OpenMPF will automatically download the .whl files using pip at build time.</li>
<li>When deployed, a virtualenv is created for the Python component so that it runs in a sandbox isolated from the rest of the system.</li>
<li>OpenMPF ImageReader and VideoCapture tools are provided in the mpf_component_util module.</li>
<li>Example Python components are provided for reference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spare Nodes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spare nodes can join and leave an OpenMPF cluster while the Workflow Manager is running. You can create a spare node by cloning an existing OpenMPF child node. Refer to the <a href="../Node-Guide/index.html">Node Guide</a>.</li>
<li>Note that changes made using the Component Registration web page only affect core nodes, not spare nodes. Core nodes are those configured during the OpenMPF installation process.</li>
<li>Added <code>mpf list-nodes</code> command to list the core nodes and available spare nodes.</li>
<li>OpenMPF now uses the JGroups FILE_PING protocol for peer discovery instead of TCPPING. This means that the list of OpenMPF nodes no longer needs to be fully specified when the Workflow Manager starts. Instead, the Workflow Manager, and Node Manager process on each node, use the files in <code>$MPF_HOME/share/nodes</code> to determine which nodes are currently available.</li>
<li>Updated JGroups from 3.6.4. to 4.0.11.</li>
<li>The environment variables specified in <code>/etc/profile.d/mpf.sh</code> have been simplified. Of note, <code>ALL_MPF_NODES</code> has been replaced by <code>CORE_MPF_NODES</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Default Detection System Properties</h2>

<ul>
<li>The detection properties that specify the default values when creating new jobs can now be updated at runtime without restarting the Workflow Manager. Changing these properties will only have an effect on new jobs, not jobs that are currently running.</li>
<li>These default detection system properties are separated from the general system properties in the Properties web page. The latter still require the Workflow Manager to be restarted for changes to take effect.</li>
<li>The Apache Commons Configuration library is now used to read and write properties files. When defining a property value using an environment variable in the Properties web page, or <code>$MPF_HOME/config/mpf-custom.properties</code>, be sure to prepend the variable name with <code>env:</code>. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>detection.models.dir.path=${env:MPF_HOME}/models/
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you can define system properties using other system properties:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>detection.models.dir.path=${mpf.share.path}/models/
</code></pre>

<h2>Adaptive Frame Interval</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>FRAME_RATE_CAP</code> property can be used to set a threshold on the maximum number of frames to process within one second of the native video time. This property takes precedence over the user-provided / pipeline-provided value for <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code>. When the <code>FRAME_RATE_CAP</code> property is specified, an internal frame interval value is calculated as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>calcFrameInterval = max(1, floor(mediaNativeFPS / frameRateCapProp));
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>FRAME_RATE_CAP</code> may be disabled by setting it &lt;= 0. <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> can be disabled in the same way.</li>
<li>If <code>FRAME_RATE_CAP</code> is disabled, then <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> will be used instead.</li>
<li>If both <code>FRAME_RATE_CAP</code> and <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> are disabled, then a value of 1 will be used for <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Darknet Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>This release includes a component that uses the <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/">Darknet neural network framework</a> to perform detection and classification of objects using trained models.</li>
<li>Pipelines for the Tiny YOLO and YOLOv2 models are provided. Due to its large size, the YOLOv2 weights file must be downloaded separately and placed in <code>$MPF_HOME/share/models/DarknetDetection</code> in order to use the YOLOv2 pipelines. Refer to <code>DarknetDetection/plugin-files/models/models.ini</code> for more information.</li>
<li>This component supports a preprocessor mode and default mode of operation. If preprocessor mode is enabled, and multiple Darknet detections in a frame share the same classification, then those are merged into a single detection where the region corresponds to the superset region that encapsulates all of the original detections, and the confidence value is the probability that at least one of the original detections is a true positive. If disabled, multiple Darknet detections in a frame are not merged together.</li>
<li>Detections are not tracked across frames. One track is generated per detection.</li>
<li>This component supports an optional <code>CLASS_WHITELIST_FILE</code> property. When provided, only detections with class names listed in the file will be generated.</li>
<li>This component can be compiled with GPU support if the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit is installed on the build machine. Refer to the <a href="../GPU-Support-Guide">GPU Support Guide</a>. If the toolkit is not found, then the component will compile with CPU support only.</li>
<li>To run on a GPU, set the <code>CUDA_DEVICE_ID</code> job property, or set the detection.cuda.device.id system property, &gt;= 0.</li>
<li>When <code>CUDA_DEVICE_ID</code> &gt;= 0, you can set the <code>FALLBACK_TO_CPU_WHEN_GPU_PROBLEM</code> job property, or the detection.use.cpu.when.gpu.problem system property, to <code>TRUE</code> if you want to run the component logic on the CPU instead of the GPU when a GPU problem is detected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Models Directory</h2>

<ul>
<li>The<code>$MPF_HOME/share/models</code> directory is now used by the Darknet and Caffe components to store model files and associated files, such as classification names files, weights files, etc. This allows users to more easily add model files post-deployment. Instead of copying the model files to <code>$MPF_HOME/plugins/&lt;component-name&gt;/models</code> directory on each node in the OpenMPF cluster, they only need to copy them to the shared directory once.</li>
<li>To add new models to the Darknet and Caffe component, add an entry to the respective <code>&lt;component-name&gt;/plugin-files/models/models.ini</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Packaging and Deployment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Python components are packaged with their respective dependencies as .whl files. This can be automated by providing a setup.py file. An example OpenCV Python component is provided that demonstrates how the component is packaged and deployed with the opencv-python module. When deployed, a virtualenv is created for the component with the .whl files installed in it.</li>
<li>When deploying OpenMPF, <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is no longer set system-wide. Refer to Known Issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web User Interface</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the Nodes page to distinguish between core nodes and spare nodes, and to show when a node is online or offline.</li>
<li>Updated the Component Registration page to list the core nodes as a reminder that changes will not affect spare nodes.</li>
<li>Updated the Properties page to separate the default detection properties from the general system properties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Custom Action, task, and pipeline names can now contain "(" and ")" characters again.</li>
<li>Detection location elements for audio tracks and generic tracks in a JSON output object will now have a y value of <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>Streaming health report and summary report timestamps have been corrected to represent hours in the 0-23 range instead of 1-24.</li>
<li>Single-frame .gif files are now segmented properly and no longer result in a NullPointerException.</li>
<li><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is now set at the process level for Tomcat, the Node Manager, and component services, instead of at the system level in <code>/etc/profile.d/mpf.sh</code>. Also, deployments no longer create <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/mpf.conf</code>. This better isolates OpenMPF from the rest of the system and prevents issues, such as being unable to use SSH, when system libraries are not compatible with OpenMPF libraries. The latter situation may occur when running <code>yum update</code> on the system, which can make OpenMPF unusable until a new deployment package with compatible libraries is installed.</li>
<li>The Workflow Manager will no longer generate an "Error retrieving the SingleJobInfo model" line in the log if someone is viewing the Job Status page when a job submitted through the REST API is in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>When multiple component services of the same type on the same node log to the same file at the same time, sometimes log lines will not be captured in the log file. The logging frameworks (log4j and log4cxx) do not support that usage. This problem happens more frequently on systems running many component services at the same time.</li>
<li>The following exception was observed:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException: Message missing required fields: data_uri

</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Further debugging is necessary to determine the reason why that message was missing that field. The situation is not easily reproducible. It may occur when ActiveMQ and / or the system is under heavy load and sends duplicate messages in attempt to ensure message delivery. Some of those messages seem to end up in the dead letter queue (DLQ). For now, we've improved the way we handle messages in the DLQ. If OpenMPF can process a message successfully, the job is marked as <code>COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS</code>, and the message is moved from <code>ActiveMQ.DLQ</code> to <code>MPF.DLQ_PROCESSED_MESSAGES</code>. If OpenMPF cannot process a message successfully, it is moved from <code>ActiveMQ.DLQ to MPF.DLQ_INVALID_MESSAGES</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <code>mpf stop</code> command will stop the Workflow Manager, which will in turn send commands to all of the available nodes to stop all running component services. If a service is processing a sub-job when the quit command is received, that service process will not terminate until that sub-job is completely processed. Thus, the service may put a sub-job response on the ActiveMQ response queue after the Workflow Manager has terminated. That will not cause a problem because the queues are flushed the next time the Workflow Manager starts; however, there will be a problem if the service finishes processing the sub-job after the Workflow Manager is restarted. At that time, the Workflow Manager will have no knowledge of the old job and will in turn generate warnings in the log about how the job id is "not known to the system" and/or "not found as a batch or a streaming job". These can be safely ignored. Often, if these messages appear in the log, then C++ services were running after stopping the Workflow Manager. To address this, you may wish to run <code>sudo killall amq_detection_component</code> after running <code>mpf stop</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="openmpf-200-february-2018">OpenMPF 2.0.0: February 2018</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Components built for previous releases of OpenMPF are not compatible with OpenMPF 2.0.0 due to Batch Component API changes to support generic detections, and changes made to the format of the <code>descriptor.json</code> file to support stream processing.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This release contains basic support for processing video streams. Currently, the only way to make use of that functionality is through the REST API. Streaming jobs and services cannot be created or monitored through the web UI. Only the SuBSENSE component has been updated to support streaming. Only single-stage pipelines are supported at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated documents to distinguish the batch component APIs from the streaming component API.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="../CPP-Streaming-Component-API/index.html">C++ Streaming Component API</a>.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../CPP-Batch-Component-API/index.html">C++ Batch Component API</a> to describe support for generic detections.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../REST-API/index.html">REST API</a> with endpoints for streaming jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Support for Generic Detections</h2>

<ul>
<li>C++ and Java components can now declare support for the <code>UNKNOWN</code> data type. The respective batch APIs have been updated with a function that will enable a component to process an <code>MPFGenericJob</code>, which represents a piece of media that is not a video, image, or audio file.</li>
<li>Note that these API changes make OpenMPF R2.0.0 incompatible with components built for previous releases of OpenMPF. Specifically, the new component executor will not be able to load the component logic library.</li>
</ul>
<h2>C++ Batch Component API</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added the following function to support generic detections:<ul>
<li><code>MPFDetectionError GetDetections(const MPFGenericJob &amp;job, vector&lt;MPFGenericTrack&gt; &amp;tracks)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Java Batch Component API</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added the following method to support generic detections:<ul>
<li><code>List&lt;MPFGenericTrack&gt; getDetections(MPFGenericJob job)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Streaming REST API</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added the following REST endpoints for streaming jobs:<ul>
<li><code>[GET] /rest/streaming/jobs</code>: Returns a list of streaming job ids.</li>
<li><code>[POST] /rest/streaming/jobs</code>: Creates and submits a streaming job. Users can register for health report and summary report callbacks.</li>
<li><code>[GET] /rest/streaming/jobs/{id}</code>: Gets information about a streaming job.</li>
<li><code>[POST] /rest/streaming/jobs/{id}/cancel</code>: Cancels a streaming job.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workflow Manager</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated to support generic detections.</li>
<li>Updated Redis to store information about streaming jobs.</li>
<li>Added controllers for streaming job REST endpoints.</li>
<li>Added ability to generate health reports and segment summary reports for streaming jobs.</li>
<li>Improved code flow between the Workflow Manager and master Node Manager to support streaming jobs.</li>
<li>Added ActiveMQ queues to enable the C++ Streaming Component Executor to send reports and job status to the Workflow Manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Node Manager</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the master Node Manager and child Node Managers to spawn component services on demand to handle streaming jobs, cancel those jobs, and to monitor the status of those processes.</li>
<li>Using .ini files to represent streaming job properties and enable better communication between a child Node Manager and C++ Streaming Component Executor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>C++ Streaming Component API</h2>

<ul>
<li>Developed the C++ Streaming Component API with the following functions:<ul>
<li><code>MPFStreamingDetectionComponent(const MPFStreamingVideoJob &amp;job)</code>: Constructor that takes a streaming video job.</li>
<li><code>string GetDetectionType()</code>: Returns the type of detection (i.e. "FACE").</li>
<li><code>void BeginSegment(const VideoSegmentInfo &amp;segment_info)</code>: Indicates the beginning of a new video segment.</li>
<li><code>bool ProcessFrame(const cv::Mat &amp;frame, int frame_number)</code>: Processes a single frame for the current video segment.</li>
<li><code>vector&lt;MPFVideoTrack&gt; EndSegment()</code>: Indicates the end of the current video segment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated the C++ Hello World component to support streaming jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>C++ Streaming Component Executor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Developed the C++ Streaming Component Executor to load a streaming component logic library, read frames from a video stream, and exercise the component logic through the C++ Streaming Component API.</li>
<li>When the C++ Streaming Component Executor cannot read a frame from the stream, it will sleep for at least 1 millisecond, doubling the amount of sleep time per attempt until it reaches the  <code>stallTimeout</code> value specified when the job was created. While stalled, the job status will be <code>STALLED</code>. After the timeout is exceeded, the job will be <code>TERMINATED</code>.</li>
<li>The C++ Streaming Component Executor supports <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code>, as well as rotation, horizontal flipping, and cropping (region of interest) properties. Does not support <code>USE_KEY_FRAMES</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interoperability Package</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added the following Java classes to the interoperability package to simplify third party integration:<ul>
<li><code>JsonHealthReportCollection</code>: Represents the JSON content of a health report callback. Contains one or more <code>JsonHealthReport</code> objects.</li>
<li><code>JsonSegmentSummaryReport</code>: Represents the JSON content of a summary report callback. Content is similar to the JSON output object used for batch processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>SuBSENSE Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>The SuBSENSE component now supports both batch processing and stream processing.</li>
<li>Each video segment will be processed independently of the rest. In other words, tracks will be generated on a segment-by-segment basis and tracks will not carry over between segments.</li>
<li>Note that the last frame in the previous segment will be used to determine if there is motion in the first frame of the next segment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Packaging and Deployment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated <code>descriptor.json</code> fields to allow components to support batch and/or streaming jobs. Components that use the old <code>descriptor.json</code> file format cannot be registered through the web UI.  </li>
<li>Batch component logic and streaming component logic are compiled into separate libraries.</li>
<li>The mySQL <code>streaming_job_request</code> table has been updated with the following fields, which are used to populate the JSON health reports:<ul>
<li><code>status_detail</code>: (Optional) A user-friendly description of the current job status.</li>
<li><code>activity_frame_id</code>: The frame id associated with the last job activity. Activity is defined as the start of a new track for the current segment.</li>
<li><code>activity_timestamp</code>: The timestamp associated with the last job activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web User Interface</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added column names to the table that appears when the user clicks in the Media button associated with a job on the Job Status page. Now descriptive comments are provided when table cells are empty.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Upgraded Tika to 1.17 to resolve an issue with improper indentation in a Python file (rotation.py) that resulted in generating at least one error message per image processed. When processing a large number of images, this would generate may error messages, causing the Automatic Bug Reporting Tool daemon (abrtd) process to run at 100% CPU. Once in that state, that process would stay there, essentially wasting on CPU core. This resulted in some of the Jenkins virtual machines we used for testing to become unresponsive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OpenCV 3.3.0 <code>cv::imread()</code> does not properly decode some TIFF images that have EXIF orientation metadata. It can handle images that are flipped horizontally, but not vertically. It also has issues with rotated images. Since most components rely on that function to read image data, those components may silently fail to generate detections for those kinds of images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using single quotes, apsotrophes, or double quotes in the name of an algorithm, action, task, or pipeline configured on an existing OpenMPF system will result in a failure to perform an OpenMPF upgrade on that system. Specifically, the step where pre-existing custom actions, tasks, and pipelines are carried over to the upgraded version of OpenMPF will fail. Please do not use those special characters while naming those elements. If this has been done already, then those elements should be manually renamed in the XML files prior to an upgrade attempt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenMPF uses OpenCV, which  uses FFmpeg, to connect to video streams. If a proxy and/or firewall prevents the network connection from succeeding, then OpenCV, or the underlying FFmpeg library, will segfault. This causes the C++ Streaming Component Executor process to fail. In turn, the job status will be set to <code>ERROR</code> with a status detail message of "Unexpected error. See logs for details". In this case, the logs will not contain any useful information. You can identify a segfault by the following line in the node-manager log:</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="openmpf-100-october-2017">OpenMPF 1.0.0: October 2017</h1>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Build-Environment-Setup-Guide/index.html">Build Guide</a> with instructions for installing the latest JDK, latest JRE, FFmpeg 3.3.3, new codecs, and OpenCV 3.3.</li>
<li>Added an <a href="../Acknowledgements/index.html">Acknowledgements</a> section that provides information on third party dependencies leveraged by the OpenMPF.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="../Feed-Forward-Guide/index.html">Feed Forward Guide</a> that explains feed forward processing and how to use it.</li>
<li>Added missing requirements checklist content to the <a href="../Install-Guide/index.html#pre-installation-checklist">Install Guide</a>.</li>
<li>Updated the README at the top level of each of the primary repositories to help with user navigation and provide general information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrade to FFmpeg 3.3.3 and OpenCV 3.3</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated core framework from FFmpeg 2.6.3 to FFmpeg 3.3.3.</li>
<li>Added the following FFmpeg codecs: x256, VP9, AAC, Opus, Speex.</li>
<li>Updated core framework and components from OpenCV 3.2 to OpenCV 3.3. No longer building with opencv_contrib.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feed Forward Behavior</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the workflow manager (WFM) and all video components to optionally perform feed forward processing for batch jobs. This allows tracks to be passed forward from one pipeline stage to the next. Components in the next stage will only process the frames associated with the detections in those tracks. This differs from the default segmenting behavior, which does not preserve detection regions or track information between stages.</li>
<li>To enable this behavior, the optional <code>FEED_FORWARD_TYPE</code> property must be set to <code>FRAME</code>, <code>SUPERSET_REGION</code>, or <code>REGION</code>. If set to <code>FRAME</code> then the components in the next stage will process the whole frame region associated with each detection in the track passed forward. If set to <code>SUPERSET_REGION</code> then the components in the next stage will determine the bounding box that encapsulates all of the detection regions in the track, and only process the pixel data within that superset region. If set to <code>REGION</code> then the components in the next stage will process the region associated with each detection in the track passed forward, which may vary in size and position from frame to frame.</li>
<li>The optional <code>FEED_FORWARD_TOP_CONFIDENCE_COUNT</code> property can be set to a number to limit the number of detections passed forward in a track. For example, if set to "5", then only the top 5 detections in the track will be passed forward and processed by the next stage. The top detections are defined as those with the highest confidence values, or if the confidence values are the same, those with the lowest frame index.</li>
<li>Note that setting the feed forward properties has no effect on the first pipeline stage because there is no prior stage that can pass tracks to it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caffe Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the Caffe component to process images in the BGR color space instead of the RGB color space. This addresses a bug found in OpenCV. Refer to the Bug Fixes section below.</li>
<li>Added support for processing videos.</li>
<li>Added support for an optional <code>ACTIVATION_LAYER_LIST</code> property. For each network layer specified in the list, the <code>detectionProperties</code> map in the JSON output object will contain one entry. The value is an encoded string of the JSON representation of an OpenCV matrix of the activation values for that layer. The activation values are obtained after the Caffe network has processed the frame data.</li>
<li>Added support for an optional <code>SPECTRAL_HASH_FILE_LIST</code> property. For each JSON file specified in the list, the <code>detectionProperties</code> map in the JSON output object will contain one entry. The value is a string of 0's and 1's representing the spectral hash calculated using the information in the spectral hash JSON file. The spectral hash is calculated using activation values after the Caffe network has processed the frame data.</li>
<li>Added a pipeline to showcase the above two features for the GoogLeNet Caffe model.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>TRANSPOSE</code> property from the Caffe component since it was not necessary.</li>
<li>Added red, green, and blue mean subtraction values to the GoogLeNet pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use Key Frames</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for an optional <code>USE_KEY_FRAMES</code> property to each video component. When true the component will only look at key frames (I-frames) from the input video. Can be used in conjunction with <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code>. For example, when <code>USE_KEY_FRAMES</code> is true, and <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> is set to "2", then every other key frame will be processed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>MPFVideoCapture and MPFImageReader Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the MPFVideoCapture and MPFImageReader tools to handle feed forward properties.</li>
<li>Updated the MPFVideoCapture tool to handle <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> and <code>USE_KEY_FRAMES</code> properties.</li>
<li>Updated all existing components to leverage these tools as much as possible.</li>
<li>We encourage component developers to use these tools to automatically take care of common frame grabbing and frame manipulation behaviors, and not to reinvent the wheel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dead Letter Queue</h2>

<ul>
<li>If for some reason a sub-job request that should have gone to a component ends up on the ActiveMQ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), then the WFM will now process that failed request so that the job can complete. The ActiveMQ management page will now show that <code>ActiveMQ.DLQ</code> has 1 consumer. It will also show unconsumed messages in <code>MPF.PROCESSED_DLQ_MESSAGES</code>. Those are left for auditing purposes. The "Message Detail" for these shows the string representation of the original job request protobuf message.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrade Path</h2>

<ul>
<li>Removed the Release 0.8 to Release 0.9 upgrade path in the deployment scripts.</li>
<li>Added support for a Release 0.9 to Release 1.0.0 upgrade path, and a Release 0.10.0 to Release 1.0.0 upgrade path.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Markup</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bounding boxes are now drawn along the interpolated path between detection regions whenever there are one or more frames in a track which do not have detections associated with them.</li>
<li>For each track, the color of the bounding box is now a randomly selected hue in the HSV color space. The colors are evenly distributed using the golden ratio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/9625">bug in OpenCV</a> where the Caffe example code was processing images in the RGB color space instead of the BGR color space. Updated the OpenMPF Caffe component accordingly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the OpenCV person detection component that caused bounding boxes to be too large for detections near the edge of a frame.</li>
<li>Resubmitting jobs now properly carries over configured job properties.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the build order of the OpenMPF project so that test modules that the WFM depends on are built before the WFM itself.</li>
<li>The Markup component draws bounding boxes between detections when a <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> is specified. This is so that the bounding box in the marked-up video appears in every frame. Fixed a bug where the bounding boxes drawn on non-detection frames appeared to stand still rather than move along the interpolated path between detection regions.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on the OALPR license plate detection component where it was not properly handling the <code>SEARCH_REGION_*</code> properties.</li>
<li>Support for the <code>MIN_GAP_BETWEEN_SEGMENTS</code> property was not implemented properly. When the gap between two segments is less than this property value then the segments should be merged; otherwise, the segments should remain separate. In some cases, the exact opposite was happening. This bug has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Because of the number of additional ActiveMQ messages involved, enabling feed forward for low resolution video may take longer than the non-feed-forward behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> MPFImageReader has been re-enabled in this version of OpenMPF since we upgraded to OpenCV 3.2, which addressed the known issues with <code>imread()</code>, auto-orientation, and jpeg files in OpenCV 3.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added a <a href="../Contributor-Guide/index.html">Contributor Guide</a> that provides guidelines for contributing to the OpenMPF codebase.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Java-Batch-Component-API/index.html">Java Batch Component API</a> with links to the example Java components.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Build-Environment-Setup-Guide/index.html">Build Guide</a> with instructions for OpenCV 3.2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrade to OpenCV 3.2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated core framework and components from OpenCV 3.1 to OpenCV 3.2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Support for Animated gifs</h2>

<ul>
<li>All gifs are now treated as videos. Each gif will be handled as an MPFVideoJob.</li>
<li>Unanimated gifs are treated as 1-frame videos.</li>
<li>The WFM Media Inspector now populates the <code>media_properties</code> map with a <code>FRAME_COUNT</code> entry (in addition to the <code>DURATION</code> and <code>FPS</code> entries).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caffe Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for the Yahoo Not Suitable for Work (NSFW) Caffe model for explicit material detection.</li>
<li>Updated the Caffe component to support the OpenCV 3.2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) module.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Support for Streaming Video</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> At this time, OpenMPF does not support streaming video. This section details what's being / has been done so far to prepare for that feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The codebase is being updated / refactored to support both the current "batch" job functionality and new "streaming" job functionality.<ul>
<li>batch job: complete video files are written to disk before they are processed</li>
<li>streaming job: video frames are read from a streaming endpoint (such as RTSP) and processed in near real time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The REST API is being updated with endpoints for streaming jobs:<ul>
<li><code>[POST] /rest/streaming/jobs</code>: Creates and submits a streaming job</li>
<li><code>[POST] /rest/streaming/jobs/{id}/cancel</code>: Cancels a streaming job</li>
<li><code>[GET] /rest/streaming/jobs/{id}</code>: Gets information about a streaming job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Redis and mySQL databases are being updated to support streaming video jobs.<ul>
<li>A batch job will never have the same id as a streaming job. The integer ids will always be unique.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The MOG and SuBSENSE component services could segfault and terminate if the <code>USE_MOTION_TRACKING</code> property was set to “1” and a detection was found close to the edge of the frame. Specifically, this would only happen if the video had a width and/or height dimension that was not an exact power of two.<ul>
<li>The reason was because the code downsamples each frame by a power of two and rounds the value of the width and height up to the nearest integer. Later on when upscaling detection rectangles back to a size that’s relative to the original image, the resized rectangle sometimes extended beyond the bounds of the original frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>If a job is submitted through the REST API, and a user to logged into the web UI and looking at the job status page, the WFM may generate "Error retrieving the SingleJobInfo model for the job with id" messages.<ul>
<li>This is because the job status is only added to the HTTP session object if the job is submitted through the web UI. When the UI queries the job status it inspects this object.</li>
<li>This message does not appear if job status is obtained using the <code>[GET] /rest/jobs/{id}</code> endpoint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>[GET] /rest/jobs/stats</code> endpoint aggregates information about all of the jobs ever run on the system. If thousands of jobs have been run, this call could take minutes to complete. The code should be improved to execute a direct mySQL query.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="openmpf-090-april-2017">OpenMPF 0.9.0: April 2017</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> MPFImageReader has been disabled in this version of OpenMPF. Component developers should use MPFVideoCapture instead. This affects components developed against previous versions of OpenMPF and components developed against this version of OpenMPF. Please refer to the Known Issues section for more information.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The OALPR Text Detection Component has been renamed to OALPR <strong>License Plate</strong> Text Detection Component. This affects the name of the component package and the name of the actions, tasks, and pipelines. When upgrading from R0.8 to R0.9, if the old OALPR Text Detection Component is installed in R0.8 then you will be prompted to install it again at the end of the upgrade path script. We recommend declining this prompt because the old component will conflict with the new component.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Action, task, and pipeline names that started with <code>MOTION DETECTION PREPROCESSOR</code> have been renamed <code>MOG MOTION DETECTION PREPROCESSOR</code>. Similarly, <code>WITH MOTION PREPROCESSOR</code> has changed to <code>WITH MOG MOTION PREPROCESSOR</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updated the <a href="../REST-API/index.html">REST API</a> to reflect job properties, algorithm-specific properties, and media-specific properties.</li>
<li>Streamlined the <a href="../CPP-Batch-Component-API/index.html">C++ Batch Component API</a> document for clarity and simplicity.</li>
<li>Completed the <a href="../Java-Batch-Component-API/index.html">Java Batch Component API</a> document.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Admin-Guide/index.html">Admin Guide</a> and <a href="../User-Guide/index.html">User Guide</a> to reflect web UI changes.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="../Build-Environment-Setup-Guide/index.html">Build Guide</a> with instructions for GitHub repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workflow Manager</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for job properties, which will override pre-defined pipeline properties.</li>
<li>Added support for algorithm-specific properties, which will apply to a single stage of the pipeline and will override job properties and pre-defined pipeline properties.</li>
<li>Added support for media-specific properties, which will apply to a single piece and media and will override job properties, algorithm-specific properties, and pre-defined pipeline properties.</li>
<li>Components can now be automatically registered and installed when the web application starts in Tomcat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web User Interface</h2>

<ul>
<li>The "Close All" button on pop-up notifications now dismisses all notifications from the queue, not just the visible ones.</li>
<li>Job completion notifications now only appear for jobs created during the current login session instead of all jobs.</li>
<li>The <code>ROTATION</code>, <code>HORIZONTAL_FLIP</code>, and <code>SEARCH_REGION_*</code> properties can be set using the web interface when creating a job. Once files are selected for a job, these properties can be set individually or by groups of files.</li>
<li>The Node and Process Status page has been merged into the Node Configuration page for simplicity and ease of use.</li>
<li>The Media Markup results page has been merged into the Job Status page for simplicity and ease of use.</li>
<li>The File Manager UI has been improved to handle large numbers of files and symbolic links.</li>
<li>The side navigation menu is now replaced by a top navigation bar.</li>
</ul>
<h2>REST API</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added an optional jobProperties object to the <code>/rest/jobs/</code> request which contains String key-value pairs which override the pipeline's pre-configured job properties.</li>
<li>Added an optional algorithmProperties object to the <code>/rest/jobs/</code> request which can be used to configure properties for specific algorithms in the pipeline. These properties override the pipeline's pre-configured job properties. They also override the values in the jobProperties object.</li>
<li>Updated the <code>/rest/jobs/</code> request to add more detail to media, replacing a list of mediaUri Strings with a list of media objects, each of which contains a mediaUri and an optional mediaProperties map. The mediaProperties map can be used to configure properties for the specific piece of media. These properties override the pipeline's pre-configured job properties, values in the jobProperties object, and values in the algorithmProperties object.</li>
<li>Streamlined the actions, tasks, and pipelines endpoints that are used by the web UI.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flipping, Rotation, and Region of Interest</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>ROTATION</code>, <code>HORIZONTAL_FLIP</code>, and <code>SEARCH_REGION_*</code> properties will no longer appear in the detectionProperties map in the JSON detection output object. When applied to an algorithm these properties now appear in the pipeline.stages.actions.properties element. When applied to a piece of media these properties will now appear in the the media.mediaProperties element.</li>
<li>The OpenMPF now supports multiple regions of interest in a single media file.  Each region will produce tracks separately, and the tracks for each region will be listed in the JSON output as if from a separate media file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Component API</h2>

<ul>
<li>Java Batch Component API is functionally complete for third-party development, with the exception of Component Adapter and frame transformation utilities classes.</li>
<li>Re-architected the Java Batch Component API to use a more traditional Java method structure of returning track lists and throwing exceptions (rather than modifying input track lists and returning statuses), and encapsulating job properties into MPFJob objects:<ul>
<li><code>List&lt;MPFVideoTrack&gt; getDetections(MPFVideoJob job) throws MPFComponentDetectionError</code></li>
<li><code>List&lt;MPFAudioTrack&gt; getDetections(MPFAudioJob job) throws MPFComponentDetectionError</code></li>
<li><code>List&lt;MPFImageLocation&gt; getDetections(MPFImageJob job) throws MPFComponentDetectionError</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created examples for the Java Batch Component API.</li>
<li>Reorganized the Java and C++ component source code to enable component development without the OpenMPF core, which will simplify component development and streamline the code base.</li>
</ul>
<h2>JSON Output Objects</h2>

<ul>
<li>The JSON output object for the job now contains a jobProperties map which contains all properties defined for the job in the job request.  For example, if the job request specifies a <code>CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD</code> of then the jobProperties map in the output will also list a <code>CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD</code> of 5.</li>
<li>The JSON output object for the job now contains a algorithmProperties element which contains all algorithm-specific properties defined for the job in the job request.  For example, if the job request specifies a <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> of 2 for FACECV then the algorithmProperties element in the output will contain an entry for "FACECV" and that entry will list a <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code> of 2.</li>
<li>Each JSON media output object now contains a mediaProperties map which contains all media-specific properties defined by the job request.  For example, if the job request specifies a <code>ROTATION</code> of 90 degrees for a single piece of media then the mediaProperties map for that piece of piece will list a <code>ROTATION</code> of 90.</li>
<li>The content of JSON output objects are now organized by detection type (e.g. MOTION, FACE, PERSON, TEXT, etc.) rather than action type.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caffe Component</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for flip, rotation, and cropping to regions of interest.</li>
<li>Added support for returning multiple classifications per detection based on user-defined settings. The classification list is in order of decreasing confidence value.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Pipelines</h2>

<ul>
<li>New SuBSENSE motion preprocessor pipelines have been added to components that perform detection on video.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Packaging and Deployment</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>Actions.xml</code>, <code>Algorithms.xml</code>, <code>nodeManagerConfig.xml</code>, <code>nodeServicesPalette.json</code>, <code>Pipelines.xml</code>, and <code>Tasks.xml</code> are no longer stored within the Workflow Manager WAR file. They are now stored under <code>$MPF_HOME/data</code>. This makes it easier to upgrade the Workflow Manager and makes it easier for users to access these files.</li>
<li>Each component can now be optionally installed and registered during deployment. Components not registered are set to the <code>UPLOADED</code> state. They can then be removed or registered through the Component Registration page.</li>
<li>Java components are now packaged as tar.gz files instead of RPMs, bringing them into alignment with C++ components.</li>
<li>OpenMPF R0.9 can be installed over OpenMPF R0.8. The deployment scripts will determine that an upgrade should take place.<ul>
<li>After the upgrade, user-defined actions, tasks, and pipelines will have "CUSTOM" prepended to their name.</li>
<li>The job_request table in the mySQL database will have a new "output_object_version" column. This column will have "1.0" for jobs created using OpenMPF R0.8 and "2.0" for jobs created using OpenMPF R0.9. The JSON output object schema has changed between these versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reorganized source code repositories so that component SDKs can be downloaded separately from the OpenMPF core and so that components are grouped by license and maturity. Build scripts have been created to streamline and simplify the build process across the various repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrade to OpenCV 3.1</h2>

<ul>
<li>The OpenMPF software has been ported to use OpenCV 3.1, including all of the C++ detection components and the markup component. For the OpenALPR license plate detection component, the versions of the openalpr, tesseract, and leptonica libraries were also upgraded to openalpr-2.3.0, tesseract-3.0.4, and leptonica-1.7.2.  For the SuBSENSE motion component, the version of the SuBSENSE library was upgraded to use the code found at this location: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pierre_luc_st_charles/subsense/src">https://bitbucket.org/pierre_luc_st_charles/subsense/src</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>MOG motion detection always detected motion in frame 0 of a video. Because motion can only be detected between two adjacent frames, frame 1 is now the first frame in which motion can be detected.</li>
<li>MOG motion detection never detected motion in the first frame of a video segment (other than the first video segment because of the frame 0 bug described above). Now, motion is detected using the first frame before the start of a segment, rather than the first frame of the segment.</li>
<li>The above bugs were also present in SuBSENSE motion detection and have been fixed.</li>
<li>SuBSENSE motion detection generated tracks where the frame numbers were off by one. Corrected the frame index logic.</li>
<li>Very large video files caused an out of memory error in the system during Workflow Manager media inspection.</li>
<li>A job would fail when processing images with an invalid metadata tag for the camera flash setting.</li>
<li>Users were permitted to select invalid file types using the File Manager UI.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>MPFImageReader does not work reliably with the current release version of OpenCV 3.1</strong>: In OpenCV 3.1, new functionality was introduced to interpret EXIF information when reading jpeg files.</li>
<li>There are two issues with this new functionality that impact our ability to use the OpenCV <code>imread()</code> function with MPFImageReader:<ul>
<li>First, because of a bug in the OpenCV code, reading a jpeg file that contains exif information could cause it to hang. (See <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/6665">https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/6665</a>.)</li>
<li>Second, it is not possible to tell the <code>imread()</code>function to ignore the EXIF data, so the image it returns is automatically rotated. (See <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/6348">https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/6348</a>.) This results in the MPFImageReader applying a second rotation to the image due to the EXIF information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To address these issues, we developed the following workarounds:<ul>
<li>Created a version of the MPFVideoCapture that works with an MPFImageJob. The new MPFVideoCapture can pull frames from both video files and images. MPFVideoCapture leverages cv::VideoCapture, which does not have the two issues described above.</li>
<li>Disabled the use of MPFImageReader to prevent new users from trying to develop code leveraging this previous functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
