# API Overview

In OpenMPF, a **component** is a plugin that receives jobs (containing media), processes that  media, and returns results.

The OpenMPF Batch Component API currently supports the development of **detection components**, which are used detect objects in image, video, audio, or other (generic) files that reside on disk.

Using this API, detection components can be built to provide:

* Detection (Localizing an object)
* Tracking (Localizing an object across multiple frames)
* Classification (Detecting the type of object and optionally localizing that object)
* Transcription (Detecting speech and transcribing it into text)

## How Components Integrate into OpenMPF

Components are integrated into OpenMPF through the use of OpenMPF's **Component Executable**. Developers create component libraries that encapsulate the component detection logic. Each instance of the Component Executable loads one of these libraries and uses it to service job requests sent by the OpenMPF Workflow Manager (WFM).

The Component Executable:

1. Receives and parses job requests from the WFM
2. Invokes functions on the component library to obtain detection results
3. Populates and sends the respective responses to the WFM

The basic psuedocode for the Component Executable is as follows:

```c++
component->SetRunDirectory(...)
component->Init()
while (true) {
    job = ReceiveJob()
    if (component->Supports(job.data_type))
        component->GetDetections(...) // Component logic does the work here
    SendJobResponse()
}
component->Close()
```

Each instance of a Component Executable runs as a separate process.

The Component Executable receives and parses requests from the WFM, invokes functions on the Component Logic to get detection objects, and subsequently populates responses with the component output and sends them to the WFM.

A component developer implements a detection component by extending [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface).

As an alternative to extending [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface) directly, a developer may extend one of several convenience adapter classes provided by OpenMPF. See [Convenience Adapters](#convenience-adapters) for more information.


## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with the C++ Batch Component API is to first read the [OpenMPF Component API Overview](Component-API-Overview/index.html) and then [review the source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/tree/master/detection/examples) for example OpenMPF C++ detection components.

Detection components are implemented by:

1. Extending [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface).
2. Building the component into a shared object library. (See [HelloWorldComponent CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/examples/HelloWorldComponent/CMakeLists.txt)).
3. Packaging the component into an OpenMPF-compliant .tar.gz file. (See [Component Packaging](#component-packaging)).
4. Registering the component with OpenMPF. (See [Packaging and Registering a Component](Packaging-and-Registering-a-Component/index.html)).

# API Specification

The figure below presents a high-level component diagram of the C++ Batch Component API:

![OpenMPF Component Diagram](img/component_diagram_cpp_batch.png "OpenMPF Component Diagram")

The API consists of *Component Interfaces*, which provide interfaces and abstract classes for developing components; *Job Definitions*, which define the work to be performed by a component; *Job Results*, which define the results generated by the component; [*Component Adapters*](#convenience-adapters), which provide default implementations of several of the [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface) interface functions; and [*Component Utilities*](#utility-classes), which perform actions such as image rotation, and cropping.

**Component Interface**

* [`MPFComponent`](#component-interface) - Abstract base class for components.

**Detection Component Interface**

* [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface) extends [`MPFComponent`](#component-interface) - Abstract class that should be extended by all OpenMPF C++ detection components that perform batch processing.

**Job Definitions**

The following data structures contain details about a specific job (work unit):

* [`MPFImageJob`](#mpfimagejob) extends [`MPFJob`](#mpfjob)
* [`MPFVideoJob`](#mpfvideojob) extends [`MPFJob`](#mpfjob)
* [`MPFAudioJob`](#mpfaudiojob) extends [`MPFJob`](#mpfjob)
* [`MPFGenericJob`](#mpfgenericjob) extends [`MPFJob`](#mpfjob)

**Job Results**

The following data structures define detection results:

* [`MPFImageLocation`](#mpfimagelocation)
* [`MPFVideoTrack`](#mpfvideotrack)
* [`MPFAudioTrack`](#mpfaudiotrack)
* [`MPFGenericTrack`](#mpfgenerictrack)

Components must also include two [Component Factory Functions](#component-factory-functions).


## Component Interface

The `MPFComponent` class is the abstract base class utilized by all OpenMPF C++ components that perform batch processing.

**[See the latest source here.](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/interface/include/MPFComponentInterface.h)**

>**IMPORTANT:** This interface should not be directly implemented, because no mechanism exists for launching components based off of it. Currently, the only supported type of component is detection, and all batch detection components should instead extend [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface).

### SetRunDirectory(string)

Sets the value of the private `run_directory` data member which contains the full path of the parent folder above where the component is installed.

* Function Definition:
```c++
void SetRunDirectory(const string &run_dir)
```

* Parameters:

| Parameter  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| run_dir  | `const string &`  | Full path of the parent folder above where the component is installed. |

* Returns: none

>**IMPORTANT:** `SetRunDirectory` is called by the Component Executable to set the correct path. This function should not be called within your implementation.

### GetRunDirectory()

Returns the value of the private `run_directory` data member which contains the full path of the parent folder above where the component is installed. This parent folder is also known as the plugin folder.

* Function Definition:
```c++
string GetRunDirectory()
```

* Parameters: none

* Returns: (`string`) Full path of the parent folder above where the component is installed.

* Example:

```c++
string run_dir = GetRunDirectory();
string plugin_path = run_dir + "/SampleComponent";
string config_path = plugin_path + "/config";
string logconfig_file = config_path + "/Log4cxxConfig.xml";
```

### Init()

The component should perform all initialization operations in the `Init` member function.
This will be executed once by the Component Executable, on component startup, before the first job, after `SetRunDirectory`.

* Function Definition:
```c++
bool Init()
```

* Parameters: none

* Returns: (`bool`) Return true if initialization is successful, otherwise return false.

* Example:

```c++
bool SampleComponent::Init() {
  // Get component paths
  string run_dir = GetRunDirectory();
  string plugin_path = run_dir + "/SampleComponent";
  string config_path = plugin_path + "/config";

  // Setup logger, load data models, etc.

  return true;
}
```

### Close()

The component should perform all shutdown operations in the `Close` member function.
This will be executed once by the Component Executable, on component shutdown, usually after the last job.

This function is called before the component instance is deleted (see [Component Factory Functions](CPP-Batch-Component-API/index.html#component-factory-functions)).

* Function Definition:
```c++
bool Close()
```

* Parameters: none

* Returns: (`bool`) Return true if successful, otherwise return false.

* Example:

```c++
bool SampleComponent::Close() {
    // Free memory, etc.
    return true;
}
```

### GetComponentType()

The GetComponentType() member function allows the C++ Batch Component API to determine the component "type." Currently `MPF_DETECTION_COMPONENT` is the only supported component type. APIs for other component types may be developed in the future.

* Function Definition:
```c++
MPFComponentType GetComponentType()
```

* Parameters: none

* Returns: (`MPFComponentType`) Currently, `MPF_DETECTION_COMPONENT` is the only supported return value.

* Example:

```c++
MPFComponentType SampleComponent::GetComponentType() {
    return MPF_DETECTION_COMPONENT;
};
```

### Component Factory Functions
Every detection component must include the following macros in its implementation:

```c++
MPF_COMPONENT_CREATOR(TYPENAME);
```

```c++
MPF_COMPONENT_DELETER();
```

The creator macro takes the `TYPENAME` of the detection component (for example, “HelloWorld”). This macro creates the factory function that the OpenMPF Component Executable will call in order to instantiate the detection component. The creation function is called once, to obtain an instance of the component, after the component library has been loaded into memory.

The deleter macro creates the factory function that the Component Executable will use to delete that instance of the detection component.

These macros must be used outside of a class declaration, preferably at the bottom or top of a component source (.cpp) file.

**Example:**

```c++
// Note: Do not put the TypeName/Class Name in quotes
MPF_COMPONENT_CREATOR(HelloWorld);
MPF_COMPONENT_DELETER();
```

## Detection Component Interface

The `MPFDetectionComponent` class is the abstract class utilized by all OpenMPF C++ detection components that perform batch processing. This class provides functions for developers to integrate detection logic into OpenMPF.

[**See the latest source here.**](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/MPFDetectionComponent.h)

>**IMPORTANT:** Each batch detection component must implement all of the `GetDetections()` functions or extend from a superclass which provides implementations for them (see [convenience adapters](#convenience-adapters)).
>
>If your component does not support a particular data type, it should simply:
>`return MPF_UNSUPPORTED_DATA_TYPE;`


### Convenience Adapters

As an alternative to extending [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface) directly, developers may extend one of several convenience adapter classes provided by OpenMPF.

These adapters provide default implementations of several functions in [`MPFDetectionComponent`](#detection-component-interface) and ensure that the component's logic properly extends from the Component API. This enables developers to concentrate on implementation of the detection algorithm.

The following adapters are provided:

* Image Detection ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/adapters/MPFImageDetectionComponentAdapter.h))
* Video Detection ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/adapters/MPFVideoDetectionComponentAdapter.h))
* Image and Video Detection ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/adapters/MPFImageAndVideoDetectionComponentAdapter.h))
* Audio Detection ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/adapters/MPFAudioDetectionComponentAdapter.h))
* Audio and Video Detection ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/adapters/MPFAudioAndVideoDetectionComponentAdapter.h))
* Generic Detection ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/develop/detection/api/include/adapters/MPFGenericDetectionComponentAdapter.h))

>**Example: Creating Adaptors to Perform Naive Tracking:**
>A simple detector that operates on videos may simply go through the video frame-by-frame, extract each frame’s data, and perform detections on that data as though it were processing a new unrelated image each time. As each frame is processed, one or more `MPFImageLocations` are generated.
>
>Generally, it is preferred that a detection component that supports `VIDEO` data is able to perform tracking across video frames to appropriately correlate `MPFImageLocation` detections across frames.
>
>An adapter could be developed to perform simple tracking. This would correlate `MPFImageLocation` detections across frames by naïvely looking for bounding box regions in each contiguous frame that overlap by a given threshold such as 50%.

#### Supports(MPFDetectionDataType)

Returns true or false depending on the data type is supported or not.

* Function Definition:
```c++
bool Supports(MPFDetectionDataType data_type)
```

* Parameters:

| Parameter  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| data_type| `MPFDetectionDataType`  | Return true if the component supports IMAGE, VIDEO, AUDIO, and/or UNKNOWN (generic) processing. |

* Returns: (`bool`) True if the component supports the data type, otherwise false.

* Example:

```c++
// Sample component that supports only image and video files
bool SampleComponent::Supports(MPFDetectionDataType data_type) {
    return data_type == MPFDetectionDataType::IMAGE || data_type == MPFDetectionDataType::VIDEO;
}
```

#### GetDetectionType()

Returns the type of object detected by the component.

* Function Definition:
```c++
string GetDetectionType()
```

* Parameters: none

* Returns: (`string`) The type of object detected by the component. Should be in all CAPS. Examples include: `FACE`, `MOTION`, `PERSON`, `SPEECH`, `CLASS` (for object classification), or `TEXT`.

* Example:

```c++
string SampleComponent::GetDetectionType() {
    return "FACE";
}
```

#### GetDetections(MPFImageJob …)

Used to detect objects in an image file. The MPFImageJob structure contains the data_uri specifying the location of the image file.

Currently, the data_uri is always a local file path. For example, "/opt/mpf/share/remote-media/test-file.jpg". This is because all media is copied to the OpenMPF server before the job is executed.

* Function Definition:
```c++
MPFDetectionError GetDetections(const MPFImageJob &job, vector<MPFImageLocation> &locations)
```

* Parameters:

| Parameter  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|  job | `const MPFImageJob &`  | Structure containing details about the work to be performed. See [`MPFImageJob`](#mpfimagejob) |
|  locations | `vector<MPFImageLocation> &` | The [`MPFImageLocation`](#mpfimagelocation) data for each detected object.   |

* Returns: `MPFDetectionError`

* Example:

```c++
MPFDetectionError SampleComponent::GetDetections(const MPFImageJob &job, vector<MPFImageLocation> &locations) {
    // Parse job
    // Generate image locations
    return MPF_DETECTION_SUCCESS;
}
```

#### GetDetections(MPFVideoJob …)

Used to detect objects in a video file. Prior to being sent to the component, videos are split into logical "segments" of video data and each segment (containing a range of frames) is assigned to a different job. Components are not guaranteed to receive requests in any order. For example, the first request processed by a component might receive a request for frames 300-399 of a Video A, while the next request may cover frames 900-999 of a Video B.

* Function Definition:
```c++
MPFDetectionError getDetections(const MPFVideoJob &job, vector<MPFVideoTrack> tracks);
```

* Parameters:

| Parameter  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| job  | `const MPFVideoJob &`  |  Structure containing details about the work to be performed. See [`MPFVideoJob`](#mpfvideojob) |
| tracks  | `vector<MPFVideoTrack> &` | The [`MPFVideoTrack`](#mpfvideotrack) data for each detected object.  |

* Returns: `MPFDetectionError`

* Example:

```c++
MPFDetectionError SampleComponent::GetDetections(const MPFAudioJob &job, vector<MPFAudioTrack> &tracks) {
    // Parse job
    // Generate tracks
    return MPF_DETECTION_SUCCESS;
}
```

#### GetDetections(MPFAudioJob …)

Used to detect objects in an audio file. Currently, audio files are not logically segmented, so a job will contain the entirety of the audio file.

* Function Definition:
```c++
MPFDetectionError GetDetections(const MPFAudioJob &job, vector<MPFAudioTrack> &tracks)
```

* Parameters:

| Parameter  | Data Type  | Description  |

| job  | `const MPFAudioJob &`  | Structure containing details about the work to be performed. See [`MPFAudioJob`](#mpfaudiojob) |
| tracks  | `vector<MPFAudioTrack> &` |  The [`MPFAudioTrack`](#mpfaudiotrack) data for each detected object  |

* Returns: `MPFDetectionError`

* Example:

```c++
MPFDetectionError GetDetections(const MPFAudioJob &job, vector<MPFAudioTrack> &tracks) {
    // Parse job
    // Generate tracks
    return MPF_DETECTION_SUCCESS;
}
```

#### GetDetections(MPFGenericJob …)

Used to detect objects in files that aren't video, image, or audio files. Such files are of the UNKNOWN type and handled generically. These files are not logically segmented, so a job will contain the entirety of the file.

* Function Definition:
```c++
MPFDetectionError GetDetections(const MPFGenericJob &job, vector<MPFGenericTrack> &tracks)
```

* Parameters:

| Parameter  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| job  | `const MPFGenericJob &`  | Structure containing details about the work to be performed. See [`MPFGenericJob`](#mpfgenericjob) |
| tracks  | `vector<MPFGenericTrack> &` |  The [`MPFGenericTrack`](#mpfgenerictrack) data for each detected object  |

* Returns: `MPFDetectionError`

* Example:

```c++
MPFDetectionError GetDetections(const MPFGenericJob &job, vector<MPFGenericTrack> &tracks) {
    // Parse job
    // Generate tracks
    return MPF_DETECTION_SUCCESS;
}
```

>**IMPORTANT:** `FRAME_INTERVAL` is a common job property that many components support. For frame intervals greater than 1, the component must look for detections starting with the first frame, and then skip frames as specified by the frame interval, until or before it reaches the stop frame. For example, given a start frame of 0, a stop frame of 99, and a frame interval of 2, then the detection component must look for objects in frames numbered 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., 98.


#### MPFAudioJob

### Detection Job Result Classes

#### MPFImageLocation

Structure used to store the location of detected objects in a image file.

* Constructor(s):
```c++
MPFImageLocation()
MPFImageLocation(
  int x_left_upper,
  int y_left_upper,
  int width,
  int height,
  float confidence = -1,
  const Properties &detection_properties = {})
```

* Members:

| Member  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| x_left_upper| `int` | Upper left X coordinate of the detected object. |
| y_left_upper | `int` | Upper left Y coordinate of the detected object. |
| width | `int` | The width of the detected object. |
| height | `int` | The height of the detected object. |
| confidence | `float` | Represents the "quality" of the detection. The range depends on the detection algorithm. 0.0 is lowest quality. Higher values are higher quality. Using a standard range of [0.0 - 1.0] is advised. If the component is unable to supply a confidence value, it should return -1.0. |
| detection_properties | `Properties &` | Optional additional information about the detected object. There is no restriction on the keys or the number of entries that can be added to the detection_properties map. For best practice, keys should be in all CAPS. See note about `ROTATION` below. |

When the `detection_properties` map contains a `ROTATION` key, it should be a floating point value in the interval
`[0.0, 360.0)` indicating the orientation of the detection in degrees in the counter-clockwise direction.
In order to view the detection in the upright orientation, it must be rotated the given number of degrees in the
clockwise direction. When the `ROTATION` key is present, `x_left_upper` and `y_left_upper` indicate the top left of
the correctly oriented detection. Similarly, `width` and `height` indicate the dimensions of the correctly oriented
detection.

* Example:

![Lenna 90 CCW with Markup](img/lenna_90_ccw_markup.png "Lenna 90 degrees CCW with Markup")


In the above image with markup, the cyan dot in the bottom-left corner of the bounding box represents the top-left corner of the detection region when correctly oriented.


```c++
MPFImageLocation detection;
detection.x_left_upper = 156;
detection.y_left_upper = 339;
detection.width = 194;
detection.height = 243;
detection.confidence = 1.0;
detection.detection_properties["ROTATION"] = "90.0";
```

* Example:

A component that performs generic object classification can add an entry to `detection_properties` where the key is `CLASSIFICATION` and the value is the type of object detected.

```c++
MPFImageLocation detection;
detection.x_left_upper = 0;
detection.y_left_upper = 0;
detection.width = 100;
detection.height = 50;
detection.confidence = 1.0;
detection.detection_properties["CLASSIFICATION"] = "backpack";
```

#### MPFVideoTrack

Structure used to store the location of detected objects in a video file.

* Constructor(s):
```c++
MPFVideoTrack()
MPFVideoTrack(
  int start_frame,
  int stop_frame,
  float confidence = -1,
  map<int, MPFImageLocation> frame_locations,
  const Properties &detection_properties = {})
```

* Members:

| Member  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| start_frame| `int` | The first frame number (0-based index) that contained the detected object. |
| stop_frame| `int` | The last frame number (0-based index) that contained the detected object. |
| frame_locations| `map<int, MPFImageLocation>` | A map of individual detections. The key for each map entry is the frame number where the detection was generated, and the value is a [`MPFImageLocation`](#mpfimagelocation) calculated as if that frame was a still image. Note that a key-value pair is *not* required for every frame between the track start frame and track stop frame. |
| confidence | `float` | Represents the "quality" of the detection. The range depends on the detection algorithm. 0.0 is lowest quality. Higher values are higher quality. Using a standard range of [0.0 - 1.0] is advised. If the component is unable to supply a confidence value, it should return -1.0. |
| detection_properties | `Properties &` | Optional additional information about the detected object. There is no restriction on the keys or the number of entries that can be added to the detection_properties map. For best practice, keys should be in all CAPS. |

* Example:

>**NOTE:** Currently, `MPFVideoTrack.detection_properties` do not show up in the JSON output object or are used by the WFM in any way.

A component that detects text can add an entry to `detection_properties` where the key is `TRANSCRIPTION` and the value is a string representing the text found in the video segment.

```c++
MPFVideoTrack track;
track.start_frame = 0;
track.stop_frame = 5;
track.confidence = 1.0;
track.frame_locations = frame_locations;
track.detection_properties["TRANSCRIPTION"] = "RE5ULTS FR0M A TEXT DETECTER";
```

#### MPFAudioTrack

Structure used to store the location of detected objects in an audio file.

* Constructor(s):
```c++
MPFAudioTrack()
MPFAudioTrack(
  int start_time,
  int stop_time,
  float confidence = -1,
  const Properties &detection_properties = {})
```

* Members:

| Member  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| start_time| `int` | The time (0-based index, in ms) when the audio detection event started.  |
| stop_time| `int` | The time (0-based index, in ms) when the audio detection event stopped. |
| confidence | `float` | Represents the "quality" of the detection. The range depends on the detection algorithm. 0.0 is lowest quality. Higher values are higher quality. Using a standard range of [0.0 - 1.0] is advised. If the component is unable to supply a confidence value, it should return -1.0. |
| detection_properties | `Properties &` | Optional additional information about the detection. There is no restriction on the keys or the number of entries that can be added to the detection_properties map. For best practice, keys should be in all CAPS. |

>**NOTE:** Currently, `MPFAudioTrack.detection_properties` do not show up in the JSON output object or are used by the WFM in any way.

#### MPFGenericTrack

Structure used to store the location of detected objects in a file that is not a video, image, or audio file. The file is of the UNKNOWN type and handled generically.

* Constructor(s):
```c++
MPFGenericTrack()
MPFGenericTrack(
  float confidence = -1,
  const Properties &detection_properties = {})
```

* Members:

| Member  | Data Type  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| confidence | `float` | Represents the "quality" of the detection. The range depends on the detection algorithm. 0.0 is lowest quality. Higher values are higher quality. Using a standard range of [0.0 - 1.0] is advised. If the component is unable to supply a confidence value, it should return -1.0. |
| detection_properties | `Properties &` | Optional additional information about the detection. There is no restriction on the keys or the number of entries that can be added to the detection_properties map. For best practice, keys should be in all CAPS. |

### Enumeration Types

#### MPFDetectionError

Enum used to indicate the status of a `GetDetections` call. A component is not required to support all error types.

|  ENUM  |   Description  |
|---|---|
| MPF_DETECTION_SUCCESS  | The execution of any component function has completed normally with no errors.       |
| MPF_OTHER_DETECTION_ERROR_TYPE | The component function has failed for a reason that is not captured by any of the other error codes. |
| MPF_DETECTION_NOT_INITIALIZED | The initialization of the component, or the initialization of any of its dependencies, has failed for any reason. |
| MPF_UNRECOGNIZED_DATA_TYPE | The media data type received by a component is not one of the values contained in the MPFDetectionDataType enum.  Note that this failure is normally caught by the Component Executable, before a job is passed to the component logic. |
| MPF_UNSUPPORTED_DATA_TYPE | The job passed to a component requests processing of a job of an unsupported type. For instance, a component that is only capable of processing audio files should return this error code if a video or image job request is received. |
| MPF_INVALID_DATAFILE_URI | The string containing the URI location of the input data file is invalid or empty. |
| MPF_COULD_NOT_OPEN_DATAFILE | The data file to be processed could not be opened for any reason, such as a permissions failure, or an unreachable URI. |
| MPF_COULD_NOT_READ_DATAFILE | There is a failure reading data from a successfully opened input data file. |
| MPF_FILE_WRITE_ERROR | The component received a failure for any reason when attempting to write to a file. |
| MPF_IMAGE_READ_ERROR | The component failed to read the image provided by the URI. For example, it might indicate the failure of a call to `MPFImageReader::GetImage()`, or `cv::imread()`. |
| MPF_BAD_FRAME_SIZE | The frame data retrieved has an incorrect or invalid frame size. For example, if a call to `cv::imread()` returns a frame of data with either the number of rows or columns less than or equal to 0. |
| MPF_BOUNDING_BOX_SIZE_ERROR | The calculation of a detection location bounding box has failed. For example, a component may be using an external library to detect objects, but the bounding box returned by that library lies partially outside the frame boundaries. |
| MPF_INVALID_FRAME_INTERVAL | An invalid or unsupported frame interval was received. |
| MPF_INVALID_START_FRAME | The component received an invalid start frame number. For example, if the start frame is less than zero, or greater than the stop frame, this error code should be used. |
| MPF_INVALID_STOP_FRAME | The component receives an invalid stop frame number. For example, if the stop frame is less than the start frame, or greater than the number of the last frame in a video segment, this error code should be used. |
| MPF_DETECTION_FAILED | General failure of a detection algorithm.  This does not indicate a lack of detections found in the media, but rather a break down in the algorithm that makes it impossible to continue to try to detect objects. |
| MPF_DETECTION_TRACKING_FAILED | General failure of a tracking algorithm.  This does not indicate a lack of tracks generated for the media, but rather a break down in the algorithm that makes it impossible to continue to try to track objects. |
| MPF_INVALID_PROPERTY | The component received a property that is unrecognized or has an invalid/out-of-bounds value. |
| MPF_MISSING_PROPERTY | The component received a job that is missing a required property. |
| MPF_JOB_PROPERTY_IS_NOT_INT | A job property is supposed to be an integer type, but it is of some other type, such as a boolean or a floating point value. |
| MPF_JOB_PROPERTY_IS_NOT_FLOAT | A job property is supposed to be a floating point type, but it is of some other type, such as a boolean value. |
| MPF_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_FAILED | The component failed to allocate memory for any reason. |
| MPF_GPU_ERROR | The job was configured to execute on a GPU, but there was an issue with the GPU or no GPU was detected. |

### Utility Classes

For convenience, the OpenMPF provides the `MPFImageReader` ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/MPFImageReader.h)) and `MPFVideoCapture` ([source](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk/blob/master/detection/api/include/MPFVideoCapture.h)) utility classes to perform horizontal flipping, rotation, and cropping to a region of interest. Note, that when using these classes, the component will also need to utilize the class to perform a reverse transform to convert the transformed pixel coordinates back to the original (e.g. pre-flipped, pre-rotated, and pre-cropped) coordinate space.


# C++ Component Build Environment

A C++ component library must be built for the same C++ compiler and Linux version that is used by the OpenMPF Component Executable. This is to ensure compatibility between the executable and the library functions at the Application Binary Interface (ABI) level. At this writing, the OpenMPF runs on CentOS 7.4.1708 (kernel version 3.10.0-693), and the OpenMPF C++ Component Executable is built with g++ (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16).

Components should be supplied as a tar file, which includes not only the component library, but any other libraries or files needed for execution. This includes all other non-standard libraries used by the component (aside from the standard Linux and C++ libraries), and any configuration or data files.

# Component Development Best Practices

## Single-threaded Operation

Implementations are encouraged to operate in single-threaded mode. OpenMPF will parallelize components through multiple instantiations of the component, each running as a separate service.

## Stateless Behavior
OpenMPF components should be stateless in operation and give identical output for a provided input (i.e. when processing the same `MPFJob`).

## GPU Support

For components that want to take advantage of NVIDA GPU processors, please read the [GPU Support Guide](GPU-Support-Guide/index.html). Also ensure that your build environment has the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit installed, as described in the [Build Environment Setup Guide](Build-Environment-Setup-Guide/index.html).

## Component Packaging
It is recommended that C++ components are organized according to the following directory structure:

```
componentName
├── config - Logging and other component-specific configuration
├── descriptor
│   └── descriptor.json
└── lib
    └──libComponentName.so - Compiled component library
```  

Once built, components should be packaged into a .tar.gz containing the contents of the directory shown above.


## Logging

It is recommended to use [Apache log4cxx](https://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/index.html) for OpenMPF Component logging.

Note that multiple instances of the same component can log to the same file. Also, logging content can span multiple lines.

Log files should be output to:
`${MPF_LOG_PATH}/${THIS_MPF_NODE}/log/<componentName>.log`

Each log statement must take the form:
`DATE TIME LEVEL CONTENT`

The following log LEVELs are supported:
`FATAL, ERROR, WARN,  INFO,  DEBUG, TRACE`.

For example:
`2016-02-09 13:42:42,341 INFO - Starting sample-component: [  OK  ]`

The following configuration can be used to match the format of other OpenMPF logs:

```xml
<log4j:configuration xmlns:log4j="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">

  <!-- Output the log message to log file-->
  <appender name="SAMPLECOMPONENT-FILE" class="org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender">
    <param name="file" value="${MPF_LOG_PATH}/${THIS_MPF_NODE}/log/<componentName>.log" />
    <param name="DatePattern" value="'.'yyyy-MM-dd" />
    <layout class="org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout">
      <param name="ConversionPattern" value="%d %p [%t] %c{36}:%L - %m%n" />
    </layout>
  </appender>

  <logger name= "SampleComponent" additivity="false">
    <level value="INFO"/>
    <appender-ref ref="SAMPLECOMPONENT-FILE"/>
  </logger>

</log4j:configuration>
```
